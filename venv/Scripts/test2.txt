If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is
where I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were
occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap,
but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place,
that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two
hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They're quite
touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They're nice and all—I'm
not saying that—but they're also touchy as hell. Besides, I'm not going to tell you
my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman
stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down
and had to come out here and take it easy. I mean that's all I told D.B. about, and
he's my brother and all. He's in Hollywood. That isn't too far from this crumby
place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. He's going to
drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of
those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him
damn near four thousand bucks. He's got a lot of dough, now. He didn't use to. He
used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote this terrific book of
short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in
it was “The Secret Goldfish.” It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody
look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now
he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the
movies. Don't even mention them to me.
   Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is
this school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You've
probably seen the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines,
always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all
you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse
anywhere near the place. And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always
says: “Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young
men.” Strictly for the birds. They don't do any damn more mold ing at Pencey than
they do at any other school. And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid
and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably came
to Pencey that way.
   Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game
with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the
last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old
Pencey didn't win. I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing
way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in
the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you
could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn't see the
grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the
Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny



                                          1

and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought
many people with them.
   There were never many girls at all at the football games. Only seniors were allowed
to bring girls with them. It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it. I
like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while,
even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling
or something. Old Selma Thurmer—she was the headmaster's daughter—showed
up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad
with desire. She was a pretty nice girl, though. I sat next to her once in the bus
from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation. I liked her. She had a big
nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those
damn falsies that point all over the place, but you felt sort of sorry for her. What I
liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy
her father was. She probably knew what a phony slob he was.
   The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game,
was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the
goddam manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We'd gone in to New York
that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn't have the
meet. I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn't
all my fault. I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get
off. So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime. The
whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in
a way.
   The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to
say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher. He had the grippe, and I figured I
probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me this
note saying he wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn't coming back
to Pencey.
   I forgot to tell you about that. They kicked me out. I wasn't supposed to come
back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not
applying myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself—
especially around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old
Thurmer—but I didn't do it. So I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently
at Pencey. It has a very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does.
   Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on
top of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. The
week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room,
with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of crooks.
Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks
anyway. The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has—I'm not kidding.
Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and
freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn't watching the game too much. What I was really
hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by. I mean I've left
schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them. I hate that. I don't care



                                          2

if it's a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm
leaving it. If you don't, you feel even worse.
   I was lucky. All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know
I was getting the hell out. I suddenly remembered this time, in around October,
that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in
front of the academic building. They were nice guys, especially Tichener. It was
just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball
around anyway. It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the
ball any more, but we didn't want to stop doing what we were doing. Finally we
had to. This teacher that taught biology, Mr. Zambesi, stuck his head out of this
window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready
for dinner. If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can get a good-by
when I need one—at least, most of the time I can. As soon as I got it, I turned
around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer's
house. He didn't live on the campus. He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.
   I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath.
I have no wind, if you want to know the truth. I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one
thing—that is, I used to be. They made me cut it out. Another thing, I grew six
and a half inches last year. That's also how I practically got t.b. and came out here
for all these goddam checkups and stuff. I'm pretty healthy, though.
   Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204. It was icy as
hell and I damn near fell down. I don't even know what I was running for—I guess
I just felt like it. After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing.
It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything,
and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.
   Boy, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer's house. I was really frozen.
My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all. “C'mon, c'mon,”
I said right out loud, almost, “somebody open the door.” Finally old Mrs. Spencer
opened. it. They didn't have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door
themselves. They didn't have too much dough.
   “Holden!” Mrs. Spencer said. “How lovely to see you! Come in, dear! Are you
frozen to death?” I think she was glad to see me. She liked me. At least, I think
she did.
   Boy, did I get in that house fast. “How are you, Mrs. Spencer?” I said. “How's
Mr. Spencer?”
   “Let me take your coat, dear,” she said. She didn't hear me ask her how
Mr. Spencer was. She was sort of deaf.
   She hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with
my hand. I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much.
“How've you been, Mrs. Spencer?” I said again, only louder, so she'd hear me.
   “I've been just fine, Holden.” She closed the closet door. “How have you been?”
The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer'd told her I'd been kicked
out.
   “Fine,” I said. “How's Mr. Spencer? He over his grippe yet?”

  “Over it! Holden, he's behaving like a perfect—I don't know what . . . He's in his
room, dear. Go right in.”

They each had their own room and all. They were both around seventy years old, or
even more than that. They got a bang out of things, though—in a haif-assed way,
of course. I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean. I just mean
that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too
much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for. I mean he was all stooped
over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece
of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick
it up and hand it to him. That's awful, in my opinion. But if you thought about
him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing
too bad for himself. For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were
over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he
and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park. You could tell old
Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it. That's what I mean. You take somebody
old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket.
   His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all. I
could see where he was sitting. He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up
in that blanket I just told you about. He looked over at me when I knocked. “Who's
that?” he yelled. “Caulfield? Come in, boy.” He was always yelling, outside class.
It got on your nerves sometimes.
   The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come. He was reading the Atlantic
Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled
like Vicks Nose Drops. It was pretty depressing. I'm not too crazy about sick people,
anyway. What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty
old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something. I don't much like to see
old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway. Their bumpy old chests are always
showing. And their legs. Old guys' legs, at beaches and places, always look so white
and unhairy. “Hello, sir,” I said. “I got your note. Thanks a lot.” He'd written me
this note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account
of I wasn't coming back. “You didn't have to do all that. I'd have come over to say
good-by anyway.”
   “Have a seat there, boy,” old Spencer said. He meant the bed.
   I sat down on it. “How's your grippe, sir?”
   “M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor,” old Spencer said. That
knocked him out. He started chuckling like a madman. Then he finally straightened
himself out and said, “Why aren't you down at the game? I thought this was the
day of the big game.”
   “It is. I was. Only, I just got back from New York with the fencing team,” I said.
Boy, his bed was like a rock.




                                           4

         He started getting serious as hell. I knew he would. “So you're leaving us, eh?”
he said.
   “Yes, sir. I guess I am.”
   He started going into this nodding routine. You never saw anybody nod as much
in your life as old Spencer did. You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he
was thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn't know his ass
from his elbow.
   “What did Dr. Thurmer say to you, boy? I understand you had quite a little
chat.”
   “Yes, we did. We really did. I was in his office for around two hours, I guess.”
   “What'd he say to you?”
   “Oh . . . well, about Life being a game and all. And how you should play it
according to the rules. He was pretty nice about it. I mean he didn't hit the ceiling
or anything. He just kept talking about Life being a game and all. You know.”
   “Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.”
   “Yes, sir. I know it is. I know it.”
   Game, my ass. Some game. If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are,
then it's a game, all right—I'll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where
there aren't any hot-shots, then what's a game about it? Nothing. No game. “Has
Dr. Thurmer written to your parents yet?” old Spencer asked me.
   “He said he was going to write them Monday.”
   “Have you yourself communicated with them?”
   “No, sir, I haven't communicated with them, because I'll probably see them
Wednesday night when I get home.”
   “And how do you think they'll take the news?”
   “Well . . . they'll be pretty irritated about it,” I said. “They really will. This is
about the fourth school I've gone to.” I shook my head. I shake my head quite a
lot. “Boy!” I said. I also say “Boy!” quite a lot. Partly because I have a lousy
vocabulary and partly because I act quite young for my age sometimes. I was sixteen
then, and I'm seventeen now, and sometimes I act like I'm about thirteen. It's really
ironical, because I'm six foot two and a half and I have gray hair. I really do. The
one side of my head—the right side—is full of millions of gray hairs. I've had them
ever since I was a kid. And yet I still act sometimes like I was only about twelve.
Everybody says that, especially my father. It's partly true, too, but it isn't all true.
People always think something's all true. I don't give a damn, except that I get
bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age. Sometimes I act a lot older
than I am—I really do—but people never notice it. People never notice anything.
   Old Spencer started nodding again. He also started picking his nose. He made
out like he was only pinching it, but he was really getting the old thumb right in
there. I guess he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in
the room. I didn't care, except that it's pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick
their nose.
   Then he said, “I had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they
had their little chat with Dr. Thurmer some weeks ago. They're grand people.”



                                           5

                  “Yes, they are. They're very nice.”
      Grand. There's a word I really hate. It's a phony. I could puke every time I hear
it.
   Then all of a sudden old Spencer looked like he had something very good, some-
thing sharp as a tack, to say to me. He sat up more in his chair and sort of moved
around. It was a false alarm, though. All he did was lift the Atlantic Monthly off
his lap and try to chuck it on the bed, next to me. He missed. It was only about
two inches away, but he missed anyway. I got up and picked it up and put it down
on the bed. All of a sudden then, I wanted to get the hell out of the room. I could
feel a terrific lecture coming on. I didn't mind the idea so much, but I didn't feel
like being lectured to and smell Vicks Nose Drops and look at old Spencer in his
pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time. I really didn't.
   It started, all right. “What's the matter with you, boy?” old Spencer said. He
said it pretty tough, too, for him. “How many subjects did you carry this term?”
   “Five, sir.”
   “Five. And how many are you failing in?”
   “Four.” I moved my ass a little bit on the bed. It was the hardest bed I ever sat
on. “I passed English all right,” I said, “because I had all that Beowulf and Lord
Randal My Son stuff when I was at the Whooton School. I mean I didn't have to
do any work in English at all hardly, except write compositions once in a while.”
   He wasn't even listening. He hardly ever listened to you when you said something.
   “I flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing.”
   “I know that, sir. Boy, I know it. You couldn't help it.”
   “Absolutely nothing,” he said over again. That's something that drives me crazy.
When people say something twice that way, after you admit it the first time. Then
he said it three times. “But absolutely nothing. I doubt very much if you opened
your textbook even once the whole term. Did you? Tell the truth, boy.”
   “Well, I sort of glanced through it a couple of times,” I told him. I didn't want
to hurt his feelings. He was mad about history.
   “You glanced through it, eh?” he said—very sarcastic. “Your, ah, exam paper is
over there on top of my chiffonier. On top of the pile. Bring it here, please.”
   It was a very dirty trick, but I went over and brought it over to him—I didn't
have any alternative or anything. Then I sat down on his cement bed again. Boy,
you can't imagine how sorry I was getting that I'd stopped by to say good-by to
him.
   He started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something. “We studied
the Egyptians from November 4th to December 2nd,” he said. “You chose to write
about them for the optional essay question. Would you care to hear what you had
to say?”
   “No, sir, not very much,” I said.
   He read it anyway, though. You can't stop a teacher when they want to do
something. They just do it.




                                            6

     The Egyptians were an ancient race of Caucasians residing in one of
      the northern sections of Africa. The latter as we all know is the largest
      continent in the Eastern Hemisphere.

  I had to sit there and listen to that crap. It certainly was a dirty trick.

      The Egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for various reasons.
      Modern science would still like to know what the secret ingredients were
      that the Egyptians used when they wrapped up dead people so that their
      faces would not rot for innumerable centuries. This interesting riddle is
      still quite a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century.

   He stopped reading and put my paper down. I was beginning to sort of hate
him. “Your essay, shall we say, ends there,” he said in this very sarcastic voice.
You wouldn't think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all. “However, you
dropped me a little note, at the bottom of the page,” he said.
   “I know I did,” I said. I said it very fast because I wanted to stop him before
he started reading that out loud. But you couldn't stop him. He was hot as a
firecracker.

      Dear Mr. Spencer [he read out loud]. That is all I know about the
      Egyptians. I can't seem to get very interested in them although your
      lectures are very interesting. It is all right with me if you flunk me
      though as I am flunking everything else except English anyway.
      Respectfully yours, Holden Caulfield.

   He put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like he'd just beaten hell
out of me in ping-pong or something. I don't think I'll ever forgive him for reading
me that crap out loud. I wouldn't've read it out loud to him if he'd written it—
I really wouldn't. In the first place, I'd only written that damn note so that he
wouldn't feel too bad about flunking me.
   “Do you blame me for flunking you, boy?” he said.
   “No, sir! I certainly don't,” I said. I wished to hell he'd stop calling me “boy” all
the time.
   He tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it. Only,
he missed again, naturally. I had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top
of the Atlantic Monthly. It's boring to do that every two minutes.
   “What would you have done in my place?” he said. “Tell the truth, boy.”
   Well, you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me. So I shot the
bull for a while. I told him I was a real moron, and all that stuff. I told him how I
would've done exactly the same thing if I'd been in his place, and how most people
didn't appreciate how tough it is being a teacher. That kind of stuff. The old bull.
   The funny thing is, though, I was sort of thinking of something else while I shot
the bull. I live in New York, and I was thinking about the lagoon in Central Park,
down near Central Park South. I was wondering if it would be frozen over when I



                                           7

got home, and if it was, where did the ducks go. I was wondering where the ducks
went when the lagoon got all icy and frozen over. I wondered if some guy came in
a truck and took them away to a zoo or something. Or if they just flew away.
   I'm lucky, though. I mean I could shoot the old bull to old Spencer and think
about those ducks at the same time. It's funny. You don't have to think too hard
when you talk to a teacher. All of a sudden, though, he interrupted me while I was
shooting the bull. He was always interrupting you.
   “How do you feel about all this, boy? I'd be very interested to know. Very
interested.”
   “You mean about my flunking out of Pencey and all?” I said. I sort of wished
he'd cover up his bumpy chest. It wasn't such a beautiful view.
   “If I'm not mistaken, I believe you also had some difficulty at the Whooton School
and at Elkton Hills.” He didn't say it just sarcastic, but sort of nasty, too.
   “I didn't have too much difficulty at Elkton Hills,” I told him. “I didn't exactly
flunk out or anything. I just quit, sort of.”
   “Why, may I ask?”
   “Why? Oh, well it's a long story, sir. I mean it's pretty complicated.” I didn't feel
like going into the whole thing with him. He wouldn't have understood it anyway.
It wasn't up his alley at all. One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was
because I was surrounded by phonies. That's all. They were coming in the goddam
window. For instance, they had this headmaster, Mr. Haas, that was the phoniest
bastard I ever met in my life. Ten times worse than old Thurmer. On Sundays, for
instance, old Haas went around shaking hands with everybody's parents when they
drove up to school. He'd be charming as hell and all. Except if some boy had little
old funny-looking parents. You should've seen the way he did with my roommate's
parents. I mean if a boy's mother was sort of fat or corny-looking or something,
and if somebody's father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big
shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes, then old Hans would just shake hands
with them and give them a phony smile and then he'd go talk, for maybe a half an
hour, with somebody else's parents. I can't stand that stuff. It drives me crazy. It
makes me so depressed I go crazy. I hated that goddam Elkton Hills.
   Old Spencer asked me something then, but I didn't hear him. I was thinking
about old Haas. “What, sir?” I said.
   “Do you have any particular qualms about leaving Pencey?”
   “Oh, I have a few qualms, all right. Sure . . . but not too many. Not yet, anyway.
I guess it hasn't really hit me yet. It takes things a while to hit me. All I'm doing
right now is thinking about going home Wednesday. I'm a moron.”
   “Do you feel absolutely no concern for your future, boy?”
   “Oh, I feel some concern for my future, all right. Sure. Sure, I do.” I thought
about it for a minute. “But not too much, I guess. Not too much, I guess.”
   “You will,” old Spencer said. “You will, boy. You will when it's too late.”
   I didn't like hearing him say that. It made me sound dead or something. It was
very depressing. “I guess I will,” I said.




                                           8

   “I'd like to put some sense in that head of yours, boy. I'm trying to help you. I'm
trying to help you, if I can.”
   He really was, too. You could see that. But it was just that we were too much
on opposite sides ot the pole, that's all. “I know you are, sir,” I said. “Thanks a
lot. No kidding. I appreciate it. I really do.” I got up from the bed then. Boy, I
couldn't've sat there another ten minutes to save my life. “The thing is, though, I
have to get going now. I have quite a bit of equipment at the gym I have to get to
take home with me. I really do.” He looked up at me and started nodding again,
with this very serious look on his face. I felt sorry as hell for him, all of a sudden.
But I just couldn't hang around there any longer, the way we were on opposite sides
of the pole, and the way he kept missing the bed whenever he chucked something
at it, and his sad old bathrobe with his chest showing, and that grippy smell of
Vicks Nose Drops all over the place. “Look, sir. Don't worry about me,” I said. “I
mean it. I'll be all right. I'm just going through a phase right now. Everybody goes
through phases and all, don't they?”
   “I don't know, boy. I don't know.”
   I hate it when somebody answers that way. “Sure. Sure, they do,” I said. “I
mean it, sir. Please don't worry about me.” I sort of put my hand on his shoulder.
“Okay?” I said.
   “Wouldn't you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go? Mrs. Spencer would
be—”
   “I would, I really would, but the thing is, I have to get going. I have to go right
to the gym. Thanks, though. Thanks a lot, sir.”
   Then we shook hands. And all that crap. It made me feel sad as hell, though.
   “I'll drop you a line, sir. Take care of your grippe, now.”
   “Good-by, boy.”
   After I shut the door and started back to the living room, he yelled something at
me, but I couldn't exactly hear him. I'm pretty sure he yelled “Good luck!” at me,
   I hope to hell not. I'd never yell “Good luck!” at anybody. It sounds terrible,
when you think about it.

I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way
to the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm
liable to say I'm going to the opera. It's terrible. So when I told old Spencer I had
to go to the gym and get my equipment and stuff, that was a sheer lie. I don't even
keep my goddam equipment in the gym.
   Where I lived at Pencey, I lived in the Ossenburger Memorial Wing of the new
dorms. It was only for juniors and seniors. I was a junior. My roommate was a
senior. It was named after this guy Ossenburger that went to Pencey. He made a
pot of dough in the undertaking business after he got out of Pencey. What he did, he
started these undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members
of your family buried for about five bucks apiece. You should see old Ossenburger.



                                          9

 He probably just shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river. Anyway, he
gave Pencey a pile of dough, and they named our wing alter him. The first football
game of the year, he came up to school in this big goddam Cadillac, and we all had
to stand up in the grandstand and give him a locomotive—that's a cheer. Then, the
next morning, in chapel, be made a speech that lasted about ten hours. He started
off with about fifty corny jokes, just to show us what a regular guy he was. Very
big deal. Then he started telling us how he was never ashamed, when he was in
some kind of trouble or something, to get right down his knees and pray to God.
He told us we should always pray to God—talk to Him and all—wherever we were.
He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all. He said he talked to
Jesus all the time. Even when he was driving his car. That killed me. I just see the
big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more
stiffs. The only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it. He was telling
us all about what a swell guy he was, what a hot-shot and all, then all of a sudden
this guy sitting in the row in front of me, Edgar Marsalla, laid this terrific fart.
It was a very crude thing to do, in chapel and all, but it was also quite amusing.
Old Marsalla. He damn near blew the roof off. Hardly anybody laughed out loud,
and old Ossenburger made out like he didn't even hear it, but old Thurmer, the
headmaster, was sitting right next to him on the rostrum and all, and you could tell
he heard it. Boy, was he sore. He didn't say anything then, but the next night he
made us have compulsory study hall in the academic building and he came up and
made a speech. He said that the boy that had created the disturbance in chapel
wasn't fit to go to Pencey. We tried to get old Marsalla to rip off another one,
right while old Thurmer was making his speech, but be wasn't in the right mood.
Anyway, that's where I lived at Pencey. Old Ossenburger Memorial Wing, in the
new dorms.
   It was pretty nice to get back to my room, after I left old Spencer, because
everybody was down at the game, and the heat was on in our room, for a change.
It felt sort of cosy. I took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar;
and then I put on this hat that I'd bought in New York that morning. It was this
red hunting hat, with one of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of
this sports store when we got out of the subway, just after I noticed I'd lost all the
goddam foils. It only cost me a buck. The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way
around to the back—very corny, I'll admit, but I liked it that way. I looked good in
it that way. Then I got this book I was reading and sat down in my chair. There
were two chairs in every room. I had one and my roommate, Ward Stradlater, had
one. The arms were in sad shape, because everybody was always sitting on them,
but they were pretty comfortable chairs.
   The book I was reading was this book I took out of the library by mistake. They
gave me the wrong book, and I didn't notice it till I got back to my room. They
gave me Out of Africa, by Isak Dinesen. I thought it was going to stink, but it
didn't. It was a very good book. I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot. My favorite
author is my brother D.B., and my next favorite is Ring Lardner. My brother gave
me a book by Ring Lardner for my birthday, just before I went to Pencey. It had



                                         10

these very funny, crazy plays in it, and then it had this one story about a traffic cop
that falls in love with this very cute girl that's always speeding. Only, he's married,
the cop, so be can't marry her or anything. Then this girl gets killed, because she's
always speeding. That story just about killed me. What I like best is a book that's
at least funny once in a while. I read a lot of classical books, like The Return of
the Native and all, and I like them, and I read a lot of war books and mysteries
and all, but they don't knock me out too much. What really knocks me out is a
book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a
terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like
it. That doesn't happen much, though. I wouldn't mind calling this Isak Dinesen
up. And Ring Lardner, except that D.B. told me he's dead. You take that book
Of Human Bondage, by Somerset Maugham, though. I read it last summer. It's
a pretty good book and all, but I wouldn't want to call Somerset Maugham up. I
don't know, He just isn't the kind of guy I'd want to call up, that's all. I'd rather
call old Thomas Hardy up. I like that Eustacia Vye.
   Anyway, I put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book Out of
Africa. I'd read it already, but I wanted to read certain parts over again. I'd only
read about three pages, though, when I heard somebody coming through the shower
curtains. Even without looking up, I knew right away who it was. It was Robert
Ackley, this guy that roomed right next to me. There was a shower right between
every two rooms in our wing, and about eighty-five times a day old Ackley barged
in on me. He was probably the only guy in the whole dorm, besides me, that wasn't
down at the game. He hardly ever went anywhere. He was a very peculiar guy. He
was a senior, and he'd been at Pencey the whole four years and all, but nobody ever
called him anything except “Ackley.” Not even Herb Gale, his own roommate, ever
called him “Bob” or even “Ack.” If he ever gets married, his own wife'll probably
call him “Ackley.” He was one of these very, very tall, round-shouldered guys—he
was about six four—with lousy teeth. The whole time he roomed next to me, I never
even once saw him brush his teeth. They always looked mossy and awful, and he
damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room with his mouth full of
mashed potatoes and peas or something. Besides that, he had a lot of pimples. Not
just on his forehead or his chin, like most guys, but all over his whole face. And not
only that, he had a terrible personality. He was also sort of a nasty guy. I wasn't
too crazy about him, to tell you the truth.
   I could feel him standing on the shower ledge, right behind my chair, taking a
look to see if Stradlater was around. He hated Stradlater's guts and he never came
in the room if Stradlater was around. He hated ev erybody's guts, damn near.
   He came down off the shower ledge and came in the room. “Hi,” he said. He
always said it like he was terrifically bored or terrifically tired. He didn't want you
to think he was visiting you or anything. He wanted you to think he'd come in by
mistake, for God's sake.
   “Hi,” I said, but I didn't look up from my book. With a guy like Ackley, if you
looked up from your book you were a goner. You were a goner anyway, but not as
quick if you didn't look up right away.



                                          11

 He started walking around the room, very slow and all, the way he always did,
picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier. He always picked up
your personal stuff and looked at it. Boy, could he get on your nerves sometimes.
“How was the fencing?” he said. He just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying
myself. He didn't give a damn about the fencing. “We win, or what?” he said.
   “Nobody won,” I said. Without looking up, though.
   “What?” he said. He always made you say everything twice.
   “Nobody won,” I said. I sneaked a look to see what he was fiddling around with
on my chiffonier. He was looking at this picture of this girl I used to go around with
in New York, Sally Hayes. He must've picked up that goddam picture and looked
at it at least five thousand times since I got it. He always put it back in the wrong
place, too, when he was finished. He did it on purpose. You could tell.
   “Nobody won,” he said. “How come?”
   “I left the goddam foils and stuff on the subway.” I still didn't look up at him.
   “On the subway, for Chrissake! Ya lost them, ya mean?”
   “We got on the wrong subway. I had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map
on the wall.”
   He came over and stood right in my light. “Hey,” I said. “I've read this same
sentence about twenty times since you came in.”
   Anybody else except Ackley would've taken the goddam hint. Not him, though.
“Think they'll make ya pay for em?” he said.
   “I don't know, and I don't give a damn. How 'bout sitting down or something,
Ackley kid? You're right in my goddam light.” He didn't like it when you called
him “Ackley kid.” He was always telling me I was a goddam kid, because I was
sixteen and he was eighteen. It drove him mad when I called him “Ackley kid.”
   He kept standing there. He was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldn't get out
of your light when you asked him to. He'd do it, finally, but it took him a lot longer
if you asked him to. “What the hellya reading?” he said.
   “Goddam book.”
   He shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it. “Any
good?” he said.
   “This sentence I'm reading is terrific.” I can be quite sarcastic when I'm in the
mood. He didn't get It, though. He started walking around the room again, picking
up all my personal stuff, and Stradlater's. Finally, I put my book down on the floor.
You couldn't read anything with a guy like Ackley around. It was impossible.
   I slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old Ackley making himself at
home. I was feeling sort of tired from the trip to New York and all, and I started
yawning. Then I started horsing around a little bit. Sometimes I horse around quite
a lot, just to keep from getting bored. What I did was, I pulled the old peak of my
hunting hat around to the front, then pulled it way down over my eyes. That way,
I couldn't see a goddam thing. “I think I'm going blind,” I said in this very hoarse
voice. “Mother darling, everything's getting so dark in here.”
   “You're nuts. I swear to God,” Ackley said.
   “Mother darling, give me your hand, Why won't you give me your hand ?”



                                         12

   “For Chrissake, grow up.”
   I started groping around in front of me, like a blind guy, but without getting up
or anything. I kept saying, “Mother darling, why won't you give me your hand ?” I
was only horsing around, naturally. That stuff gives me a bang sometimes. Besides,
I know it annoyed hell out of old Ackley. He always brought out the old sadist in
me. I was pretty sadistic with him quite often. Finally, I quit, though. I pulled the
peak around to the back again, and relaxed.
   “Who belongsa this?” Ackley said. He was holding my roommate's knee supporter
up to show me. That guy Ackley'd pick up anything. He'd even pick up your jock
strap or something. I told him it was Stradlater's. So he chucked it on Stradlater's
bed. He got it off Stradlater's chiffonier, so he chucked it on the bed.
   He came over and sat down on the arm of Stradlater's chair. He never sat down
in a chair. Just always on the arm. “Where the hellja get that hat?” he said.
   “New York.”
   “How much?”
   “A buck.”
   “You got robbed.” He started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a
match. He was always cleaning his fingernails. It was funny, in a way. His teeth
were always mossy-looking, and his ears were always dirty as hell, but he was always
cleaning his fingernails. I guess he thought that made him a very neat guy. He took
another look at my hat while he was cleaning them. “Up home we wear a hat like
that to shoot deer in, for Chrissake,” he said. “That's a deer shooting hat.”
   “Like hell it is.” I took it off and looked at it. I sort of closed one eye, like I was
taking aim at it. “This is a people shooting hat,” I said. “I shoot people in this
hat.”
   “Your folks know you got kicked out yet?”
   “Nope.”
   “Where the hell's Stradlater at, anyway?”
   “Down at the game. He's got a date.” I yawned. I was yawning all over the place.
For one thing, the room was too damn hot. It made you sleepy. At Pencey, you
either froze to death or died of the heat.
   “The great Stradlater,” Ackley said. “—Hey. Lend me your scissors a second,
willya? Ya got 'em handy?”
   “No. I packed them already. They're way in the top of the closet.”
   “Get 'em a second, willya?” Ackley said, “I got this hangnail I want to cut off.”
   He didn't care if you'd packed something or not and had it way in the top of the
closet. I got them for him though. I nearly got killed doing it, too. The second I
opened the closet door, Stradlater's tennis racket—in its wooden press and all—fell
right on my head. It made a big clunk, and it hurt like hell. It damn near killed
old Ackley, though. He started laughing in this very high falsetto voice. He kept
laughing the whole time I was taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors
out for him. Something like that—a guy getting hit on the head with a rock or
something—tickled the pants off Ackley. “You have a damn good sense of humor,
Ackley kid,” I told him. “You know that?” I handed him the scissors. “Lemme be



                                           13

your manager. I'll get you on the goddam radio.” I sat down in my chair again,
and he started cutting his big horny-looking nails. “How 'bout using the table or
something?” I said. “Cut 'em over the table, willya? I don't feel like walking on
your crumby nails in my bare feet tonight.” He kept right on cutting them over the
floor, though. What lousy manners. I mean it.
   “Who's Stradlater's date?” he said. He was always keeping tabs on who Stradlater
was dating, even though he hated Stradlater's guts.
   “I don't know. Why?”
   “No reason. Boy, I can't stand that sonuvabitch. He's one sonuvabitch I really
can't stand.”
   “He's crazy about you. He told me he thinks you're a goddam prince,” I said.
I call people a “prince” quite often when I'm horsing around. It keeps me from
getting bored or something.
   “He's got this superior attitude all the time,” Ackley said. “I just can't stand the
sonuvabitch. You'd think he—”
   “Do you mind cutting your nails over the table, hey?” I said. “I've asked you
about fifty—”
   “He's got this goddam superior attitude all the time,” Ackley said. “I don't even
think the sonuvabitch is intelligent. He thinks he is. He thinks he's about the
most—”
   “Ack ley! For Chrissake. Willya please cut your crumby nails over the table? I've
asked you fifty times.”
   He started cutting his nails over the table, for a change. The only way he ever
did anything was if you yelled at him.
   I watched him for a while. Then I said, “The reason you're sore at Stradlater
is because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while. He didn't
mean to insult you, for cryin' out loud. He didn't say it right or anything, but he
didn't mean anything insulting. All he meant was you'd look better and feel better
if you sort of brushed your teeth once in a while.”
   “I brush my teeth. Don't gimme that.”
   “No, you don't. I've seen you, and you don't,” I said. I didn't say it nasty, though.
I felt sort of sorry for him, in a way. I mean it isn't too nice, naturally, if somebody
tells you you don't brush your teeth. “Stradlater's all right He's not too bad,” I
said. “You don't know him, thats the trouble.”
   “I still say he's a sonuvabitch. He's a conceited sonuvabitch.”
   “He's conceited, but he's very generous in some things. He really is,” I said.
“Look. Suppose, for instance, Stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you
liked. Say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lot—I'm just giving you an
example, now. You know what he'd do? He'd probably take it off and give it ta
you. He really would. Or—you know what he'd do? He'd leave it on your bed or
something. But he'd give you the goddam tie. Most guys would probably just—”
   “Hell,” Ackley said. “If I had his dough, I would, too.”
   “No, you wouldn't.” I shook my head. “No, you wouldn't, Ackley kid. If you had
his dough, you'd be one of the biggest—”



                                          14

  “Stop calling me ‘Ackley kid,' God damn it. I'm old enough to be your lousy
father.”
    “No, you're not.” Boy, he could really be aggravating sometimes. He never missed
a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen. “In the first place,
I wouldn't let you in my goddam family,” I said.
    “Well, just cut out calling me—”
    All of a sudden the door opened, and old Stradlater barged in, in a big hurry. He
was always in a big hurry. Everything was a very big deal. He came over to me and
gave me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheeks—which is something that can
be very annoying. “Listen,” he said. “You going out anywheres special tonight?”
    “I don't know. I might. What the hell's it doing out—snowing?” He had snow
all over his coat.
    “Yeah. Listen. If you're not going out anyplace special, how 'bout lending me
your hound's-tooth jacket?”
    “Who won the game?” I said.
    “It's only the half. We're leaving,” Stradlater said. “No kidding, you gonna use
your hound's-tooth tonight or not? I spilled some crap all over my gray flannel.”
    “No, but I don't want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all,” I
said. We were practically the same heighth, but he weighed about twice as much as
I did. He had these very broad shoulders.
    “I won't stretch it.” He went over to the closet in a big hurry. “How'sa boy,
Ackley?” he said to Ackley. He was at least a pretty friendly guy, Stradlater. It
was partly a phony kind of friendly, but at least he always said hello to Ackley and
all.
    Ackley just sort of grunted when he said “How'sa boy?” He wouldn't answer him,
but he didn't have guts enough not to at least grunt. Then he said to me, “I think
I'll get going. See ya later.”
    “Okay,” I said. He never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own
room.
    Old Stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all. “I think maybe I'll take
a fast shave,” he said. He had a pretty heavy beard. He really did.
    “Where's your date?” I asked him.
    “She's waiting in the Annex.” He went out of the room with his toilet kit and
towel under his arm. No shirt on or anything. He always walked around in his bare
torso because he thought he had a damn good build. He did, too. I have to admit
it.

I didn't have anything special to do, so I went down to the can and chewed the
rag with him while he was shaving. We were the only ones in the can, because
everybody was still down at the game. It was hot as hell and the windows were
all steamy. There were about ten washbowls, all right against the wall. Stradlater
had the middle one. I sat down on the one right next to him and started turning



                                          15

the cold water on and off—this nervous habit I have. Stradlater kept whistling
“Song of India” while he shaved. He had one of those very piercing whistles that
are practically never in tune, and he always picked out some song that's hard to
whistle even if you're a good whistler, like “Song of India” or “Slaughter on Tenth
Avenue.” He could really mess a song up.
   You remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits? Well,
so was Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He
always looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he
shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and
crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished
fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did.
The reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with
himself. He thought he was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere. He
was pretty handsome, too—I'll admit it. But he was mostly the kind of a handsome
guy that if your parents saw his picture in your Year Book, they'd right away say,
“Who's this boy?” I mean he was mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy. I knew
a lot of guys at Pencey I thought were a lot handsomer than Stradlater, but they
wouldn't look handsome if you saw their pictures in the Year Book. They'd look
like they had big noses or their ears stuck out. I've had that experience frequently.
   Anyway, I was sitting on the washbowl next to where Stradlater was shaving, sort
of turning the water on and off. I still had my red hunting hat on, with the peak
around to the back and all. I really got a bang out of that hat.
   “Hey,” Stradlater said. “Wanna do me a big favor?”
   “What?” I said. Not too enthusiastic. He was always asking you to do him a big
favor. You take a very handsome guy, or a guy that thinks he's a real hot-shot, and
they're always asking you to do them a big favor. Just because they're crazy about
themself, they think you're crazy about them, too, and that you're just dying to do
them a favor. It's sort of funny, in a way.
   “You goin' out tonight?” he said.
   “I might. I might not. I don't know. Why?”
   “I got about a hundred pages to read for history for Monday,” he said. “How
'bout writing a composition for me, for English? I'll be up the creek if I don't get
the goddam thing in by Monday, the reason I ask. How 'bout it?”
   It was very ironical. It really was.
   “I'm the one that's flunking out of the goddam place, and you're asking me to
write you a goddam composition,” I said.
   “Yeah, I know. The thing is, though, I'll be up the creek if I don't get it in. Be
a buddy. Be a buddyroo. Okay?”
   I didn't answer him right away. Suspense is good for some bastards like Stradlater.
   “What on?” I said.
   “Anything. Anything descriptive. A room. Or a house. Or something you once
lived in or something—you know. Just as long as it's descriptive as hell.” He gave
out a big yawn while he said that. Which is something that gives me a royal pain
in the ass. I mean if somebody yawns right while they're asking you to do them



                                         16
a goddam favor. “Just don't do it too good, is all,” he said. “That sonuvabitch
Hartzell thinks you're a hot-shot in English, and he knows you're my roommate. So
I mean don't stick all the commas and stuff in the right place.”
   That's something else that gives me a royal pain. I mean if you're good at writing
compositions and somebody starts talking about commas. Stradlater was always
doing that. He wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing
compositions was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place. He was a
little bit like Ackley, that way. I once sat next to Ackley at this basketball game.
We had a terrific guy on the team, Howie Coyle, that could sink them from the
middle of the floor, without even touching the backboard or anything. Ackley kept
saying, the whole goddam game, that Coyle had a perfect build for basketball. God,
how I hate that stuff.
   I got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while, so I backed up a few feet and
started doing this tap dance, just for the hell of it. I was just amusing myself. I
can't really tap-dance or anything, but it was a stone floor in the can, and it was
good for tap-dancing. I started imitating one of those guys in the movies. In one
of those musicals. I hate the movies like poison, but I get a bang imitating them.
Old Stradlater watched me in the mirror while he was shaving. All I need's an
audience. I'm an exhibitionist. “I'm the goddarn Governor's son,” I said. I was
knocking myself out. Tap-dancing all over the place. “He doesn't want me to be
a tap dancer. He wants me to go to Oxford. But it's in my goddam blood, tap-
dancing.” Old Stradlater laughed. He didn't have too bad a sense of humor. “It's
the opening night of the Ziegfeld Follies.” I was getting out of breath. I have hardly
any wind at all. “The leading man can't go on. He's drunk as a bastard. So who do
they get to take his place? Me, that's who. The little ole goddam Governor's son.”
   “Where'dja get that hat?” Stradlater said. He meant my hunting hat. He'd never
seen it before.
   I was out of breath anyway, so I quit horsing around. I took off my hat and looked
at it for about the ninetieth time. “I got it in New York this morning. For a buck.
Ya like it?”
   Stradlater nodded. “Sharp,” he said. He was only flattering me, though, because
right away he said, “Listen. Are ya gonna write that composition for me? I have to
know.”
   “If I get the time, I will. If I don't, I won't,” I said. I went over and sat down at
the washbowl next to him again. “Who's your date?” I asked him. “Fitzgerald?”
   “Hell, no! I told ya. I'm through with that pig.”
   “Yeah? Give her to me, boy. No kidding. She's my type.”
   “Take her . . . She's too old for you.”
   All of a sudden—for no good reason, really, except that I was sort of in the mood
for horsing around—I felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old Stradlater
in a half nelson. That's a wrestling hold, in case you don't know, where you get the
other guy around the neck and choke him to death, if you feel like it. So I did it. I
landed on him like a goddam panther.




                                          17

   “Cut it out, Holden, for Chrissake!” Stradlater said. He didn't feel like horsing
around. He was shaving and all. “Wuddaya wanna make me do—cut my goddam
head off?”
   I didn't let go, though. I had a pretty good half nelson on him. “Liberate yourself
from my viselike grip.” I said.
   “Je-sus Christ.” He put down his razor, and all of a sudden jerked his arms up
and sort of broke my hold on him. He was a very strong guy. I'm a very weak guy.
“Now, cut out the crap,” he said. He started shaving himself all over again. He
always shaved himself twice, to look gorgeous. With his crumby old razor.
   “Who is your date if it isn't Fitzgerald?” I asked him. I sat down on the washbowl
next to him again. “That Phyllis Smith babe?”
   “No. It was supposed to he, but the arrangements got all screwed up. I got Bud
Thaw's girl's roommate now . . . Hey. I almost forgot. She knows you.”
   “Who does?” I said.
   “My date.”
   “Yeah?” I said. “What's her name?” I was pretty interested.
   “I'm thinking . . . Uh. Jean Gallagher.”
   Boy, I nearly dropped dead when he said that.
   “Jane Gallagher,” I said. I even got up from the washbowl when he said that.
I damn near dropped dead. “You're damn right I know her. She practically lived
right next door to me, the summer before last. She had this big damn Doberman
pinscher. That's how I met her. Her dog used to keep coming over in our—”
   “You're right in my light, Holden, for Chrissake,” Stradlater said. “Ya have to
stand right there?”
   Boy, was I excited, though. I really was.
   “Where is she?” I asked him. “I oughta go down and say hello to her or something.
Where is she? In the Annex?”
   “Yeah.”
   “How'd she happen to mention me? Does she go to B.M. now? She said she might
go there. She said she might go to Shipley, too. I thought she went to Shipley. How'd
she happen to mention me?” I was pretty excited. I really was.
   “I don't know, for Chrissake. Lift up, willya? You're on my towel,” Stradlater
said. I was sitting on his stupid towel.
   “Jane Gallagher,” I said. I couldn't get over it. “Jesus H. Christ.”
   Old Stradlater was putting Vitalis on his hair. My Vitalis.
   “She's a dancer,” I said. “Ballet and all. She used to practice about two hours
every day, right in the middle of the hottest weather and all. She was worried that
it might make her legs lousy—all thick and all. I used to play checkers with her all
the time.”
   “You used to play what with her all the time?”
   “Checkers.”
   “Checkers, for Chrissake!”
   “Yeah. She wouldn't move any of her kings. What she'd do, when she'd get a
king, she wouldn't move it. She'd just leave it in the back row. She'd get them all



                                         18

lined up in the back row. Then she'd never use them. She just liked the way they
looked when they were all in the back row.”
   Stradlater didn't say anything. That kind of stuff doesn't interest most people.
   “Her mother belonged to the same club we did,” I said. “I used to caddy once in
a while, just to make some dough. I caddy'd for her mother a couple of times. She
went around in about a hundred and seventy, for nine holes.”
   Stradlater wasn't hardly listening. He was combing his gorgeous locks.
   “I oughta go down and at least say hello to her,” I said.
   “Why don'tcha?”
   “I will, in a minute.”
   He started parting his hair all over again. It took him about an hour to comb his
hair.
   “Her mother and father were divorced. Her mother was married again to some
booze hound,” I said. “Skinny guy with hairy legs. I remember him. He wore shorts
all the time. Jane said he was supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing,
but all I ever saw him do was booze all the time and listen to every single goddam
mystery program on the radio. And run around the goddam house, naked. With
Jane around, and all.”
   “Yeah?” Stradlater said. That really interested him. About the booze hound
running around the house naked, with Jane around. Stradlater was a very sexy
bastard.
   “She had a lousy childhood. I'm not kidding.”
   That didn't interest Stradlater, though. Only very sexy stuff interested him.
   “Jane Gallagher. Jesus.” I couldn't get her off my mind. I really couldn't. “I
oughta go down and say hello to her, at least.”
   “Why the hell don'tcha, instead of keep saying it?” Stradlater said.
   I walked over to the window, but you couldn't see out of it, it was so steamy from
all the heat in the can. “I'm not in the mood right now,” I said. I wasn't, either.
You have to be in the mood for those things. “I thought she went to Shipley. I
could've sworn she went to Shipley.” I walked around the can for a little while. I
didn't have anything else to do. “Did she enjoy the game?” I said.
   “Yeah, I guess so. I don't know.”
   “Did she tell you we used to play checkers all the time, or anything?”
   “I don't know. For Chrissake, I only just met her,” Stradlater said. He was
finished combing his goddam gorgeous hair. He was putting away all his crumby
toilet articles.
   “Listen. Give her my regards, willya?”
   “Okay,” Stradlater said, but I knew he probably wouldn't. You take a guy like
Stradlater, they never give your regards to people.
   He went back to the room, but I stuck around in the can for a while, thinking
about old Jane. Then I went back to the room, too.
   Stradlater was putting on his tie, in front of the mirror, when I got there. He
spent around half his goddam life in front of the mirror. I sat down in my chair and
sort of watched him for a while.



                                         19
 “Hey,” I said. “Don't tell her I got kicked out, willya?”
   “Okay.”
   That was one good thing about Stradlater. You didn't have to explain every
goddam little thing with him, the way you had to do with Ackley. Mostly, I guess,
because he wasn't too interested. That's really why. Ackley, it was different. Ackley
was a very nosy bastard.
   He put on my hound's-tooth jacket.
   “Jesus, now, try not to stretch it all over the place” I said. I'd only worn it about
twice.
   “I won't. Where the hell's my cigarettes?”
   “On the desk.” He never knew where he left anything. “Under your muffler.” He
put them in his coat pocket—my coat pocket.
   I pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden, for a
change. I was getting sort of nervous, all of a sudden. I'm quite a nervous guy.
“Listen, where ya going on your date with her?” I asked him. “Ya know yet?”
   “I don't know. New York, if we have time. She only signed out for nine-thirty,
for Chrissake.”
   I didn't like the way he said it, so I said, “The reason she did that, she probably
just didn't know what a handsome, charming bastard you are. If she'd known, she
probably would've signed out for nine-thirty in the morning.”
   “Goddam right,” Stradlater said. You couldn't rile him too easily. He was too
conceited. “No kidding, now. Do that composition for me,” he said. He had his
coat on, and he was all ready to go. “Don't knock yourself out or anything, but just
make it descriptive as hell. Okay?”
   I didn't answer him. I didn't feel like it. All I said was, “Ask her if she still keeps
all her kings in the back row.”
   “Okay,” Stradlater said, but I knew he wouldn't. “Take it easy, now.” He banged
the hell out of the room.
   I sat there for about a half hour after he left. I mean I just sat in my chair, not
doing anything. I kept thinking about Jane, and about Stradlater having a date
with her and all. It made me so nervous I nearly went crazy. I already told you
what a sexy bastard Stradlater was.
   All of a sudden, Ackley barged back in again, through the damn shower curtains,
as usual. For once in my stupid life, I was really glad to see him. He took my mind
off the other stuff.
   He stuck around till around dinnertime, talking about all the guys at Pencey that
he hated their guts, and squeezing this big pimple on his chin. He didn't even use
his handkerchief. I don't even think the bastard had a handkerchief, if you want to
know the truth. I never saw him use one, anyway.

We always had the same meal on Saturday nights at Pencey. It was supposed to be
a big deal, because they gave you steak. I'll bet a thousand bucks the reason they



                                           20

did that was because a lot of guys' parents came up to school on Sunday, and old
Thurmer probably figured everybody's mother would ask their darling boy what he
had for dinner last night, and he'd say, “Steak.” What a racket. You should've seen
the steaks. They were these little hard, dry jobs that you could hardly even cut.
You always got these very lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night, and for dessert
you got Brown Betty, which nobody ate, except maybe the little kids in the lower
school that didn't know any better—and guys like Ackley that ate everything.
   It was nice, though, when we got out of the dining room. There were about three
inches of snow on the ground, and it was still coming down like a madman. It looked
pretty as hell, and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the
place. It was very childish, but everybody was really enjoying themselves.
   I didn't have a date or anything, so I and this friend of mine, Mal Brossard, that
was on the wrestling team, decided we'd take a bus into Agerstown and have a
hamburger and maybe see a lousy movie. Neither of us felt like sitting around on
our ass all night. I asked Mal if he minded if Ackley came along with us. The reason
I asked was because Ackley never did anything on Saturday night, except stay in
his room and squeeze his pimples or something. Mal said he didn't mind but that
he wasn't too crazy about the idea. He didn't like Ackley much. Anyway, we both
went to our rooms to get ready and all, and while I was putting on my galoshes and
crap, I yelled over and asked old Ackley if he wanted to go to the movies. He could
hear me all right through the shower curtains, but he didn't answer me right away.
He was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you right away. Finally he came
over, through the goddam curtains, and stood on the shower ledge and asked who
was going besides me. He always had to know who was going. I swear, if that guy
was shipwrecked somewhere, and you rescued him in a goddam boat, he'd want to
know who the guy was that was rowing it before he'd even get in. I told him Mal
Brossard was going. He said, “That bastard . . . All right. Wait a second.” You'd
think he was doing you a big favor.
   It took him about five hours to get ready. While he was doing it, I went over to
my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands. The snow
was very good for packing. I didn't throw it at anything, though. I started to throw
it. At a car that was parked across the street. But I changed my mind. The car
looked so nice and white. Then I started to throw it at a hydrant, but that looked
too nice and white, too. Finally I didn't throw it at anything. All I did was close
the window and walk around the room with the snowball, packing it harder. A little
while later, I still had it with me when I and Brossnad and Ackley got on the bus.
The bus driver opened the doors and made me throw it out. I told him I wasn't
going to chuck it at anybody, but he wouldn't believe me. People never believe you.
   Brossard and Ackley both had seen the picture that was playing, so all we did, we
just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while,
then took the bus back to Pencey. I didn't care about not seeing the movie, anyway.
It was supposed to be a comedy, with Cary Grant in it, and all that crap. Besides,
I'd been to the movies with Brossard and Ackley before. They both laughed like




                                         21

hyenas at stuff that wasn't even funny. I didn't even enjoy sitting next to them in
the movies.
   It was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm. Old Brossard
was a bridge fiend, and he started looking around the dorm for a game. Old Ackley
parked himself in my room, just for a change. Only, instead of sitting on the arm of
Stradlater's chair, he laid down on my bed, with his face right on my pillow and all.
He started talking in this very monotonous voice, and picking at all his pimples. I
dropped about a thousand hints, but I couldn't get rid of him. All he did was keep
talking in this very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had
sexual intercourse with the summer before. He'd already told me about it about a
hundred times. Every time he told it, it was different. One minute he'd be giving
it to her in his cousin's Buick, the next minute he'd be giving it to her under some
boardwalk. It was all a lot of crap, naturally. He was a virgin if ever I saw one. I
doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel. Anyway, finally I had to come right out
and tell him that I had to write a composition for Stradlater, and that he had to
clear the hell out, so I could concentrate. He finally did, but he took his time about
it, as usual. After he left, I put on my pajamas and bathrobe and my old hunting
hat, and started writing the composition.
   The thing was, I couldn't think of a room or a house or anything to describe the
way Stradlater said he had to have. I'm not too crazy about describing rooms and
houses anyway. So what I did, I wrote about my brother Allie's baseball mitt. It
was a very descriptive subject. It really was. My brother Allie had this left-handed
fielder's mitt. He was left-handed. The thing that was descriptive about it, though,
was that he had poems written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere.
In green ink. He wrote them on it so that he'd have something to read when he
was in the field and nobody was up at bat. He's dead now. He got leukemia and
died when we were up in Maine, on July 18, 1946. You'd have liked him. He was
two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty times as intelligent. He was
terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing letters to my mother, telling
her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their class. And they weren't
just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn't just that he was the
most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He
never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily,
but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I'll tell you what kind of red hair
he had. I started playing golf when I was only ten years old. I remember once, the
summer I was around twelve, teeing off and all, and having a hunch that if I turned
around all of a sudden, I'd see Allie. So I did, and sure enough, he was sitting on his
bike outside the fence—there was this fence that went all around the course—and he
was sitting there, about a hundred and fifty yards behind me, watching me tee off.
That's the kind of red hair he had. God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh
so hard at something he thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his
chair. I was only thirteen, and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all,
because I broke all the windows in the garage. I don't blame them. I really don't. I
slept in the garage the night he died, and I broke all the goddam windows with my


fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon
we had that summer, but my hand was already broken and everything by that time,
and I couldn't do it. It was a very stupid thing to do, I'll admit, but I hardly didn't
even know I was doing it, and you didn't know Allie. My hand still hurts me once
in a while when it rains and all, and I can't make a real fist any more—not a tight
one, I mean—but outside of that I don't care much. I mean I'm not going to be a
goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway.
   Anyway, that's what I wrote Stradlater's composition about. Old Allie's baseball
mitt. I happened to have it with me, in my suitcase, so I got it out and copied
down the poems that were written on it. All I had to do was change Allie's name so
that nobody would know it was my brother and not Stradlater's. I wasn't too crazy
about doing it, but I couldn't think of anything else descriptive. Besides, I sort of
liked writing about it. It took me about an hour, because I had to use Stradlater's
lousy typewriter, and it kept jamming on me. The reason I didn't use my own was
because I'd lent it to a guy down the hall.
   It was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it. I wasn't tired, though, so I
looked out the window for a while. It wasn't snowing out any more, but every once
in a while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started. You could
also hear old Ackley snoring. Right through the goddam shower curtains you could
hear him. He had sinus trouble and he couldn't breathe too hot when he was asleep.
That guy had just about everything. Sinus trouble, pimples, lousy teeth, halitosis,
crumby fingernails. You had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch.

Some things are hard to remember. I'm thinking now of when Stradlater got back
from his date with Jane. I mean I can't remember exactly what I was doing when
I heard his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor. I probably was still
looking out the window, but I swear I can't remember. I was so damn worried, that's
why. When I really worry about something, I don't just fool around. I even have
to go to the bathroom when I worry about something. Only, I don't go. I'm too
worried to go. I don't want to interrupt my worrying to go. If you knew Stradlater,
you'd have been worried, too. I'd double-dated with that bastard a couple of times,
and I know what I'm talking about. He was unscrupulous. He really was.
   Anyway, the corridor was all linoleum and all, and you could hear his goddam
footsteps coming right towards the room. I don't even remember where I was sitting
when he came in—at the window, or in my chair or his. I swear I can't remember.
   He came in griping about how cold it was out. Then he said, “Where the hell is
everybody? It's like a goddam morgue around here.” I didn't even bother to answer
him. If he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was Saturday night and everybody
was out or asleep or home for the week end, I wasn't going to break my neck telling
him. He started getting undressed. He didn't say one goddam word about Jane.
Not one. Neither did I. I just watched him. All he did was thank me for letting him
wear my hound's-tooth. He hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet.



                                           23

 Then when he was taking off his tie, he asked me if I'd written his goddam
composition for him. I told him it was over on his goddam bed. He walked over
and read it while he was unbuttoning his shirt. He stood there, reading it, and sort
of stroking his bare chest and stomach, with this very stupid expression on his face.
He was always stroking his stomach or his chest. He was mad about himself.
   All of a sudden, he said, “For Chrissake, Holden. This is about a goddam baseball
glove.”
   “So what?” I said. Cold as hell.
   “Wuddaya mean so what? I told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house
or something.”
   “You said it had to be descriptive. What the hell's the difference if it's about a
baseball glove?”
   “God damn it.” He was sore as hell. He was really furious. “You always do
everything backasswards.” He looked at me. “No wonder you're flunking the hell
out of here,” he said. “You don't do one damn thing the way you're supposed to. I
mean it. Not one damn thing.”
   “All right, give it back to me, then,” I said. I went over and pulled it right out of
his goddam hand. Then I tore it up.
   “What the hellja do that for?” he said.
   I didn't even answer him. I just threw the pieces in the wastebasket. Then I
lay down on my bed, and we both didn't say anything for a long time. He got all
undressed, down to his shorts, and I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette. You weren't
allowed to smoke in the dorm, but you could do it late at night when everybody
was asleep or out and nobody could smell the smoke. Besides, I did it to annoy
Stradlater. It drove him crazy when you broke any rules. He never smoked in the
dorm. It was only me.
   He still didn't say one single solitary word about Jane. So finally I said, “You're
back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for nine-thirty. Did you make her be
late signing in?”
   He was sitting on the edge of his bed, cutting his goddam toenails, when I asked
him that. “Coupla minutes,” he said. “Who the hell signs out for nine-thirty on a
Saturday night?” God, how I hated him.
   “Did you go to New York?” I said.
   “Ya crazy? How the hell could we go to New York if she only signed out for
nine-thirty?”
   “That's tough.”
   He looked up at me. “Listen,” he said, “if you're gonna smoke in the room, how
'bout going down to the can and do it? You may be getting the hell out of here,
but I have to stick around long enough to graduate.”
   I ignored him. I really did. I went right on smoking like a madman. All I did
was sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenails. What
a school. You were always watching somebody cut their damn toenails or squeeze
their pimples or something.
   “Did you give her my regards?” I asked him.


   The hell he did, the bastard.
   “What'd she say?” I said. “Did you ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the
back row?”
   “No, I didn't ask her. What the hell ya think we did all night—play checkers, for
Chrissake?”
   I didn't even answer him. God, how I hated him.
   “If you didn't go to New York, where'd ya go with her?” I asked him, after a
little while. I could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place. Boy, was
I getting nervous. I just had a feeling something had gone funny.
   He was finished cutting his damn toenails. So he got up from the bed, in just
his damn shorts and all, and started getting very damn playful. He came over to
my bed and started leaning over me and taking these playful as hell socks at my
shoulder. “Cut it out,” I said. “Where'd you go with her if you didn't go to New
York?”
   “Nowhere. We just sat in the goddam car.” He gave me another one of those
playtul stupid little socks on the shoulder.
   “Cut it out,” I said. “Whose car?”
   “Ed Banky's.”
   Ed Banky was the basketball coach at Pencey. Old Stradlater was one of his pets,
because he was the center on the team, and Ed Banky always let him borrow his car
when he wanted it. It wasn't allowed for students to borrow faculty guys' cars, but
all the athletic bastards stuck together. In every school I've gone to, all the athletic
bastards stick together.
   Stradlater kept taking these shadow punches down at my shoulder. He had his
toothbrush in his hand, and he put it in his mouth. “What'd you do?” I said. “Give
her the time in Ed Banky's goddam car?” My voice was shaking something awful.
   “What a thing to say. Want me to wash your mouth out with soap?”
   “Did you?”
   “That's a professional secret, buddy.”
   This next part I don't remember so hot. All I know is I got up from the bed, like
I was going down to the can or something, and then I tried to sock him, with all
my might, right smack in the toothbrush, so it would split his goddam throat open.
Only, I missed. I didn't connect. All I did was sort of get him on the side of the
head or something. It probably hurt him a little bit, but not as much as I wanted.
It probably would've hurt him a lot, but I did it with my right hand, and I can't
make a good fist with that hand. On account of that injury I told you about.
   Anyway, the next thing I knew, I was on the goddam floor and he was sitting on
my chest, with his face all red. That is, he had his goddam knees on my chest, and
he weighed about a ton. He had hold of my wrists, too, so I couldn't take another
sock at him. I'd've killed him.
   “What the hell's the matter with you?” he kept saying, and his stupid race kept
getting redder and redder.



 “Get your lousy knees off my chest,” I told him. I was almost bawling. I really
was. “Go on, get offa me, ya crumby bastard.”
   He wouldn't do it, though. He kept holding onto my wrists and I kept calling him
a sonuvabitch and all, for around ten hours. I can hardly even remember what all I
said to him. I told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like. I
told him he didn't even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back row or not, and
the reason he didn't care was because he was a goddam stupid moron. He hated it
when you called a moron. All morons hate it when you call them a moron.
   “Shut up, now, Holden,” he said with his big stupid red face. “just shut up, now.”
   “You don't even know if her first name is Jane or Jean, ya goddam moron!”
   “Now, shut up, Holden, God damn it—I'm warning ya,” he said—I really had
him going. “If you don't shut up, I'm gonna slam ya one.”
   “Get your dirty stinking moron knees off my chest.”
   “If I letcha up, will you keep your mouth shut?”
   I didn't even answer him.
   He said it over again. “Holden. If I letcha up, willya keep your mouth shut?”
   “Yes.”
   He got up off me, and I got up, too. My chest hurt like hell from his dirty knees.
“You're a dirty stupid sonuvabitch of a moron,” I told him.
   That got him really mad. He shook his big stupid finger in my face. “Holden,
God damn it, I'm warning you, now. For the last time. If you don't keep your yap
shut, I'm gonna—”
   “Why should I?” I said—I was practically yelling. “That's just the trouble with
all you morons. You never want to discuss anything. That's the way you can always
tell a moron. They never want to discuss anything intellig—”
   Then he really let one go at me, and the next thing I knew I was on the goddam
floor again. I don't remember if he knocked me out or not, but I don't think so.
It's pretty hard to knock a guy out, except in the goddam movies. But my nose
was bleeding all over the place. When I looked up old Stradlater was standing
practically right on top of me. He had his goddam toilet kit under his arm. “Why
the hell don'tcha shut up when I tellya to?” he said. He sounded pretty nervous.
He probably was scared he'd fractured my skull or something when I hit the floor.
It's too bad I didn't. “You asked for it, God damn it,” he said. Boy, did he look
worried.
   I didn't even bother to get up. I just lay there in the floor for a while, and kept
calling him a moron sonuvabitch. I was so mad, I was practically bawling.
   “Listen. Go wash your face,” Stradlater said. “Ya hear me?”
   I told him to go wash his own moron face—which was a pretty childish thing
to say, but I was mad as hell. I told him to stop off on the way to the can and
give Mrs. Schmidt the time. Mrs. Schmidt was the janitor's wife. She was around
sixty-five.
   I kept sitting there on the floor till I heard old Stradlater close the door and go
down the corridor to the can. Then I got up. I couldn't find my goddam hunting
hat anywhere. Finally I found it. It was under the bed. I put it on, and turned the



                                         26
old peak around to the back, the way I liked it, and then I went over and took a
look at my stupid face in the mirror. You never saw such gore in your life. I had
blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bath robe. It partly
scared me and it partly fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look
tough. I'd only been in about two fights in my life, and I lost both of them. I'm not
too tough. I'm a pacifist, if you want to know the truth.
  I had a feeling old Ackley'd probably heard all the racket and was awake. So I
went through the shower curtains into his room, just to see what the hell he was
doing. I hardly ever went over to his room. It always had a funny stink in it, because
he was so crumby in his personal habits.


7
A tiny bit of light came through the shower curtains and all from our room, and I
could see him lying in bed. I knew damn well he was wide awake. “Ackley?” I said.
“Y'awake?”
   “Yeah.”
   It was pretty dark, and I stepped on somebody's shoe on the floor and danm near
fell on my head. Ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm. He had a lot
of white stuff on his face, for his pimples. He looked sort of spooky in the dark.
“What the hellya doing, anyway?” I said.
   “Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing? I was tryna sleep before you guys
started making all that noise. What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?”
   “Where's the light?” I couldn't find the light. I was sliding my hand all over the
wall.
   “Wuddaya want the light for? . . . Right next to your hand.”
   I finally found the switch and turned It on. Old Ackley put his hand up so the
light wouldn't hurt his eyes.
   “Jesus!” he said. “What the hell happened to you?” He meant all the blood and
all.
   “I had a little goddam tiff with Stradlater,” I said. Then I sat down on the floor.
They never had any chairs in their room. I don't know what the hell they did with
their chairs. “Listen,” I said, “do you feel like playing a little Canasta?” He was a
Canasta fiend.
   “You're still bleed ing, for Chrissake. You better put something on it.”
   “It'll stop. Listen. Ya wanna play a little Canasta or don'tcha?”
   “Canasta, for Chrissake. Do you know what time it is, by any chance?”
   “It isn't late. It's only around eleven, eleven-thirty.”
   “Only around!” Ackley said. “Listen. I gotta get up and go to Mass in the
morning, for Chrissake. You guys start hollering and fighting in the middle of the
goddam—What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?”
   “It's a long story. I don't wanna bore ya, Ackley. I'm thinking of your welfare,”
I told him. I never discussed my personal life with him. In the first place, he was
even more stupid than Stradlater. Stradlater was a goddam genius next to Ackley.



                                         27
“Hey,” I said, “is it okay if I sleep in Ely's bed tonight? He won't be back till
tomorrow night, will he?” I knew damn well he wouldn't. Ely went home damn
near every week end.
  “I don't know when the hell he's coming back,” Ackley said.
  Boy, did that annoy me. “What the hell do you mean you don't know when he's
coming back? He never comes back till Sunday night, does he?”
  “No, but for Chrissake, I can't just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam
bed if they want to.”
  That killed me. I reached up from where I was sitting on the floor and patted him
on the goddam shoulder. “You're a prince, Ackley kid,” I said. “You know that?”
  “No, I mean it—I can't just tell somebody they can sleep in—”
  “You're a real prince. You're a gentleman and a scholar, kid,” I said. He really
was, too. “Do you happen to have any cigarettes, by any chance?—Say ‘no' or I'll
drop dead.”
  “No, I don't, as a matter of fact. Listen, what the hell was the fight about?”
  I didn't answer him. All I did was, I got up and went over and looked out the
window. I felt so lonesome, all of a sudden. I almost wished I was dead.
  “What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?” Ackley said, for about the fiftieth
time. He certainly was a bore about that.
  “About you,” I said.
  “About me, for Chrissake?”
  “Yeah. I was defending your goddam honor. Stradlater said you had a lousy
personality. I couldn't let him get away with that stuff.”
  That got him excited. “He did? No kidding? He did?”
  I told him I was only kidding, and then I went over and laid down on Ely's bed.
Boy, did I feel rotten. I felt so damn lonesome.
  “This room stinks,” I said. “I can smell your socks from way over here. Don'tcha
ever send them to the laundry?”
  “If you don't like it, you know what you can do,” Ackley said. What a witty guy.
“How 'bout turning off the goddam light?”
  I didn't turn it off right away, though. I just kept laying there on Ely's bed,
thinking about Jane and all. It just drove me stark staring mad when I thought
about her and Stradlater parked somewhere in that fat-assed Ed Banky's car. Every
time I thought about it, I felt like jumping out the window. The thing is, you didn't
know Stradlater. I knew him. Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual
intercourse with girls all the time—like Ackley, for instance—but old Stradlater
really did it. I was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time
to. That's the truth.
  “Tell me the story of your fascinating life, Ackley kid,” I said.
  “How 'bout turning off the goddam light? I gotta get up for Mass in the morning.”
  I got up and turned it off, if it made him happy. Then I laid down on Ely's bed
again.
  “What're ya gonna do—sleep in Ely's bed?” Ackley said. He was the perfect
host, boy.



                                         28
  “I may. I may not. Don't worry about it.”
   “I'm not wor ried about it. Only, I'd hate like hell if Ely came in all of a sudden
and found some guy—”
   “Relax. I'm not gonna sleep here. I wouldn't abuse your goddam hospitality.”
   A couple of minutes later, he was snoring like mad. I kept laying there in the dark
anyway, though, trying not to think about old Jane and Stradlater in that goddam
Ed Banky's car. But it was almost impossible. The trouble was, I knew that guy
Stradlater's technique. That made it even worse. We once double-dated, in Ed
Banky's car, and Stradlater was in the back, with his date, and I was in the front
with mine. What a technique that guy had. What he'd do was, he'd start snowing
his date in this very quiet, sincere voice—like as if he wasn't only a very handsome
guy but a nice, sincere guy, too. I damn near puked, listening to him. His date kept
saying, “No—please. Please, don't. Please.” But old Stradlater kept snowing her
in this Abraham Lincoln, sincere voice, and finally there'd be this terrific silence in
the back of the car. It was really embarrassing. I don't think he gave that girl the
time that night—but damn near. Damn near.
   While I was laying there trying not to think, I heard old Stradlater come back
from the can and go in our room. You could hear him putting away his crumby
toilet articles and all, and opening the window. He was a fresh-air fiend. Then, a
little while later, he turned off the light. He didn't even look around to see where I
was at.
   It was even depressing out in the street. You couldn't even hear any cars any
more. I got feeling so lonesome and rotten, I even felt like waking Ackley up.
   “Hey, Ackley,” I said, in sort of a whisper, so Stradlater couldn't hear me through
the shower curtain.
   Ackley didn't hear me, though.
   “Hey, Ackley!”
   He still didn't hear me. He slept like a rock.
   “Hey, Ackley!”
   He heard that, all right.
   “What the hell's the matter with you?” he said. “I was asleep, for Chrissake.”
   “Listen. What's the routine on joining a monastery?” I asked him. I was sort of
toying with the idea of joining one. “Do you have to be a Catholic and all?”
   “Certainly you have to be a Catholic. You bastard, did you wake me just to ask
me a dumb ques—”
   “Aah, go back to sleep. I'm not gonna join one anyway. The kind of luck I have,
I'd probably join one with all the wrong kind of monks in it. All stupid bastards.
Or just bastards.”
   When I said that, old Ackley sat way the hell up in bed. “Listen,” he said, “I
don't care what you say about me or anything, but if you start making cracks about
my goddam religion, for Chrissake—”
   “Relax,” I said. “Nobody's making any cracks about your goddam religion.” I
got up off Ely's bed, and started towards the door. I didn't want to hang around
in that stupid atmosphere any more. I stopped on the way, though, and picked up



                                          29

Ackley's hand, and gave him a big, phony handshake. He pulled it away from me.
“What's the idea?” he said.
   “No idea. I just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince, that's all,”
I said. I said it in this very sincere voice. “You're aces, Ackley kid,” I said. “You
know that?”
   “Wise guy. Someday somebody's gonna bash your—”
   I didn't even bother to listen to him. I shut the damn door and went out in the
corridor.
   Everybody was asleep or out or home for the week end, and it was very, very quiet
and depressing in the corridor. There was this empty box of Kolynos toothpaste
outside Leahy and Hoffman's door, and while I walked down towards the stairs, I
kept giving it a boot with this sheep-lined slipper I had on. What I thought I'd
do, I thought I might go down and see what old Mal Brossard was doing. But all
of a sudden, I changed my mind. All of a sudden, I decided what I'd really do,
I'd get the hell out of Pencey—right that same night and all. I mean not wait till
Wednesday or anything. I just didn't want to hang around any more. It made me
too sad and lonesome. So what I decided to do, I decided I'd take a room in a
hotel in New York—some very inexpensive hotel and all—and just take it easy till
Wednesday. Then, on Wednesday, I'd go home all rested up and feeling swell. I
figured my parents probably wouldn't get old Thurmer's letter saying I'd been given
the ax till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday. I didn't want to go home or anything till
they got it and thoroughly digested it and all. I didn't want to be around when
they first got it. My mother gets very hysterical. She's not too bad after she gets
something thoroughly digested, though. Besides, I sort of needed a little vacation.
My nerves were shot. They really were.
   Anyway, that's what I decided I'd do. So I went back to the room and turned
on the light, to start packing and all. I already had quite a few things packed.
Old Stradlater didn't even wake up. I lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then I
packed these two Gladstones I have. It only took me about two minutes. I'm a very
rapid packer.
   One thing about packing depressed me a little. I had to pack these brand-new
ice skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before. That
depressed me. I could see my mother going in Spaulding's and asking the salesman
a million dopy questions—and here I was getting the ax again. It made me feel
pretty sad. She bought me the wrong kind of skates—I wanted racing skates and
she bought hockey—but it made me sad anyway. Almost every time somebody gives
me a present, it ends up making me sad.
   After I got all packed, I sort of counted my dough. I don't remember exactly how
much I had, but I was pretty loaded. My grandmother'd just sent me a wad about
a week before. I have this grandmother that's quite lavish with her dough. She
doesn't have all her marbles any more—she's old as hell—and she keeps sending me
money for my birthday about four times a year. Anyway, even though I was pretty
loaded, I figured I could always use a few extra bucks. You never know. So what I
did was, I went down the hail and woke up Frederick Woodruff, this guy I'd lent my



                                         30
typewriter to. I asked him how much he'd give me for it. He was a pretty wealthy
guy. He said he didn't know. He said he didn't much want to buy it. Finally he
bought it, though. It cost about ninety bucks, and all he bought it for was twenty.
He was sore because I'd woke him up.
   When I was all set to go, when I had my bags and all, I stood for a while next to
the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor. I was sort of crying. I
don't know why. I put my red hunting hat on, and turned the peak around to the
back, the way I liked it, and then I yelled at the top of my goddam voice, “Sleep
tight, ya morons! ” I'll bet I woke up every bastard on the whole floor. Then I got
the hell out. Some stupid guy had thrown peanut shells all over the stairs, and I
damn near broke my crazy neck.

It was too late to call up for a cab or anything, so I walked the whole way to the
station. It wasn't too far, but it was cold as hell, and the snow made it hard for
walking, and my Gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs. I sort of enjoyed the
air and all, though. The only trouble was, the cold made my nose hurt, and right
under my upper lip, where old Stradlater'd laid one on me. He'd smacked my lip
right on my teeth, and it was pretty sore. My ears were nice and warm, though.
That hat I bought had earlaps in it, and I put them on—I didn't give a damn how
I looked. Nobody was around anyway. Everybody was in the sack.
   I was quite lucky when I got to the station, because I only had to wait about ten
minutes for a train. While I waited, I got some snow in my hand and washed my
face with it. I still had quite a bit of blood on.
   Usually I like riding on trains, especially at night, with the lights on and the
windows so black, and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and
sandwiches and magazines. I usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines.
If I'm on a train at night, I can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a
magazine without puking. You know. One of those stories with a lot of phony,
lean-jawed guys named David in it, and a lot of phony girls named Linda or Marcia
that are always lighting all the goddam Davids' pipes for them. I can even read one
of those lousy stories on a train at night, usually. But this time, it was different. I
just didn't feel like it. I just sort of sat and not did anything. All I did was take off
my hunting hat and put it in my pocket.
   All of a sudden, this lady got on at Trenton and sat down next to me. Practically
the whole car was empty, because it was pretty late and all, but she sat down next
to me, instead of an empty seat, because she had this big bag with her and I was
sitting in the front seat. She stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle, where
the conductor and everybody could trip over it. She had these orchids on, like she'd
just been to a big party or something. She was around forty or forty-five, I guess,
but she was very good looking. Women kill me. They really do. I don't mean I'm
oversexed or anything like that—although I am quite sexy. I just like them, I mean.
They're always leaving their goddam bags out in the middle of the aisle.



                                           31
  Anyway, we were sitting there, and all of a sudden she said to me, “Excuse me,
but isn't that a Pencey Prep sticker?” She was looking up at my suitcases, up on
the rack.
   “Yes, it is,” I said. She was right. I did have a goddam Pencey sticker on one of
my Gladstones. Very corny, I'll admit.
   “Oh, do you go to Pencey?” she said. She had a nice voice. A nice telephone
voice, mostly. She should've carried a goddam telephone around with her.
   “Yes, I do,” I said.
   “Oh, how lovely! Perhaps you know my son, then, Ernest Morrow? He goes to
Pencey.”
   “Yes, I do. He's in my class.”
   Her son was doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to Pencey, in the whole
crumby history of the school. He was always going down the corridor, after he'd
had a shower, snapping his soggy old wet towel at people's asses. That's exactly the
kind of a guy he was.
   “Oh, how nice!” the lady said. But not corny. She was just nice and all. “I must
tell Ernest we met,” she said. “May I ask your name, dear?”
   “Rudolf Schmidt,” I told her. I didn't feel like giving her my whole life history.
Rudolf Schmidt was the name of the janitor of our dorm.
   “Do you like Pencey?” she asked me.
   “Pencey? It's not too bad. It's not par adise or anything, but it's as good as most
schools. Some of the faculty are pretty conscientious.”
   “Ernest just adores it.”
   “I know he does,” I said. Then I started shooting the old crap around a little bit.
“He adapts himself very well to things. He really does. I mean he really knows how
to adapt himself.”
   “Do you think so?” she asked me. She sounded interested as hell.
   “Ernest? Sure,” I said. Then I watched her take off her gloves. Boy, was she
lousy with rocks.
   “I just broke a nail, getting out of a cab,” she said. She looked up at me and sort
of smiled. She had a terrifically nice smile. She really did. Most people have hardly
any smile at all, or a lousy one. “Ernest's father and I sometimes worry about him,”
she said. “We sometimes feel he's not a terribly good mixer.”
   “How do you mean?”
   “Well. He's a very sensitive boy. He's really never been a terribly good mixer
with other boys. Perhaps he takes things a little more seriously than he should at
his age.”
   Sensitive. That killed me. That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam
toilet seat.
   I gave her a good look. She didn't look like any dope to me. She looked like she
might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of. But you
can't always tell—with somebody's mother, I mean. Mothers are all slightly insane.
The thing is, though, I liked old Morrow's mother. She was all right. “Would you
care for a cigarette?” I asked her.



                                         32
  She looked all around. “I don't believe this is a smoker, Rudolf,” she said. Rudolf.
That killed me.
   “That's all right. We can smoke till they start screaming at us,” I said. She took
a cigarette off me, and I gave her a light.
   She looked nice, smoking. She inhaled and all, but she didn't wolf the smoke
down, the way most women around her age do. She had a lot of charm. She had
quite a lot of sex appeal, too, if you really want to know.
   She was looking at me sort of funny. I may be wrong but I believe your nose is
bleeding, dear, she said, all of a sudden.
   I nodded and took out my handkerchief. “I got hit with a snowball,” I said. “One
of those very icy ones.” I probably would've told her what really happened, but it
would've taken too long. I liked her, though. I was beginning to feel sort of sorry
I'd told her my name was Rudolf Schmidt. “Old Ernie,” I said. “He's one of the
most popular boys at Pencey. Did you know that?”
   “No, I didn't.”
   I nodded. “It really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him. He's
a funny guy. A strange guy, in lots of ways—know what I mean? Like when I first
met him. When I first met him, I thought he was kind of a snobbish person. That's
what I thought. But he isn't. He's just got this very original personality that takes
you a little while to get to know him.”
   Old Mrs. Morrow didn't say anything, but boy, you should've seen her. I had her
glued to her seat. You take somebody's mother, all they want to hear about is what
a hot-shot their son is.
   Then I real ly started chucking the old crap around. “Did he tell you about the
elections?” I asked her. “The class elections?”
   She shook her head. I had her in a trance, like. I really did.
   “Well, a bunch of us wanted old Ernie to be president of the class. I mean he
was the unanimous choice. I mean he was the only boy that could really handle
the job,” I said—boy, was I chucking it. “But this other boy—Harry Fencer—was
elected. And the reason he was elected, the simple and obvious reason, was because
Ernie wouldn't let us nominate him. Because he's so darn shy and modest and all.
He refused . . . Boy, he's really shy. You oughta make him try to get over that.” I
looked at her. “Didn't he tell you about it?”
   “No, he didn't.”
   I nodded. “That's Ernie. He wouldn't. That's the one fault with him—he's too
shy and modest. You really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally.”
   Right that minute, the conductor came around for old Mrs. Morrow's ticket, and
it gave me a chance to quit shooting it. I'm glad I shot it for a while, though. You
take a guy like Morrow that's always snapping their towel at people's asses—really
trying to hurt somebody with it—they don't just stay a rat while they're a kid. They
stay a rat their whole life. But I'll bet, after all the crap I shot, Mrs. Morrow'll keep
thinking of him now as this very shy, modest guy that wouldn't let us nominate him
for president. She might. You can't tell. Mothers aren't too sharp about that stuff.




                                           33
 “Would you care for a cocktail?” I asked her. I was feeling in the mood for one
myself. “We can go in the club car. All right?”
   “Dear, are you allowed to order drinks?” she asked me. Not snotty, though. She
was too charming and all to be snotty.
   “Well, no, not exactly, but I can usually get them on account of my heighth,” I
said. “And I have quite a bit of gray hair.” I turned sideways and showed her my
gray hair. It fascinated hell out of her. “C'mon, join me, why don't you?” I said.
I'd've enjoyed having her.
   “I really don't think I'd better. Thank you so much, though, dear,” she said.
“Anyway, the club car's most likely closed. It's quite late, you know.” She was
right. I'd forgotten all about what time it was.
   Then she looked at me and asked me what I was afraid she was going to ask me.
“Ernest wrote that he'd be home on Wednesday, that Christmas vacation would
start on Wednesday,” she said. “I hope you weren't called home suddenly because
of illness in the family.” She really looked worried about it. She wasn't just being
nosy, you could tell.
   “No, everybody's fine at home,” I said. “It's me. I have to have this operation.”
   “Oh! I'm so sorry,” she said. She really was, too. I was right away sorry I'd said
it, but it was too late.
   “It isn't very serious. I have this tiny little tumor on the brain.”
   “Oh, no!” She put her hand up to her mouth and all. “Oh, I'll be all right and
everything! It's right near the outside. And it's a very tiny one. They can take it
out in about two minutes.”
   Then I started reading this timetable I had in my pocket. Just to stop lying.
Once I get started, I can go on for hours if I feel like it. No kidding. Hours.
   We didn't talk too much after that. She started reading this Vogue she had with
her, and I looked out the window for a while. She got off at Newark. She wished
me a lot of luck with the operation and all. She kept calling me Rudolf. Then she
invited me to visit Ernie during the summer, at Gloucester, Massachusetts. She
said their house was right on the beach, and they had a tennis court and all, but I
just thanked her and told her I was going to South America with my grandmother.
Which was really a hot one, because my grandmother hardly ever even goes out of
the house, except maybe to go to a goddam matinee or something. But I wouldn't
visit that sonuvabitch Morrow for all the dough in the world, even if I was desperate.

The first thing I did when I got off at Penn Station, I went into this phone booth.
I felt like giving somebody a buzz. I left my bags right outside the booth so that
I could watch them, but as soon as I was inside, I couldn't think of anybody to
call up. My brother D.B. was in Hollywood. My kid sister Phoebe goes to bed
around nine o'clock—so I couldn't call her up. She wouldn't've cared if I'd woke
her up, but the trouble was, she wouldn't've been the one that answered the phone.
My parents would be the ones. So that was out. Then I thought of giving Jane



                                         34
Gallagher's mother a buzz, and find out when Jane's vacation started, but I didn't
feel like it. Besides, it was pretty late to call up. Then I thought of calling this girl I
used to go around with quite frequently, Sally Hayes, because I knew her Christmas
vacation had started already—she'd written me this long, phony letter, inviting me
over to help her trim the Christmas tree Christmas Eve and all—but I was afraid
her mother'd answer the phone. Her mother knew my mother, and I could picture
her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother I was in New
York. Besides, I wasn't crazy about talking to old Mrs. Hayes on the phone. She
once told Sally I was wild. She said I was wild and that I had no direction in life.
Then I thought of calling up this guy that went to the Whooton School when I was
there, Carl Luce, but I didn't like him much. So I ended up not calling anybody.
I came out of the booth, after about twenty minutes or so, and got my bags and
walked over to that tunnel where the cabs are and got a cab.
   I'm so damn absent-minded, I gave the driver my regular address, just out of
habit and all—I mean I completely forgot I was going to shack up in a hotel for a
couple of days and not go home till vacation started. I didn't think of it till we were
halfway through the park. Then I said, “Hey, do you mind turning around when
you get a chance? I gave you the wrong address. I want to go back downtown.”
   The driver was sort of a wise guy. “I can't turn around here, Mac. This here's a
one-way. I'll have to go all the way to Ninedieth Street now.”
   I didn't want to start an argument. “Okay,” I said. Then I thought of something,
all of a sudden. “Hey, listen,” I said. “You know those ducks in that lagoon right
near Central Park South? That little lake? By any chance, do you happen to know
where they go, the ducks, when it gets all frozen over? Do you happen to know, by
any chance?” I realized it was only one chance in a million.
   He turned around and looked at me like I was a madman. “What're ya tryna do,
bud?” he said. “Kid me?”
   “No—I was just interested, that's all.”
   He didn't say anything more, so I didn't either. Until we came out of the park at
Ninetieth Street. Then he said, “All right, buddy. Where to?”
   “Well, the thing is, I don't want to stay at any hotels on the East Side where I
might run into some acquaintances of mine. I'm traveling incognito,” I said. I hate
saying corny things like “traveling incognito.” But when I'm with somebody that's
corny, I always act corny too. “Do you happen to know whose band's at the Taft or
the New Yorker, by any chance?”
   “No idear, Mac.”
   “Well—take me to the Edmont then,” I said. “Would you care to stop on the way
and join me for a cocktail? On me. I'm loaded.”
   “Can't do it, Mac. Sorry.” He certainly was good company. Terrific personality.
   We got to the Edmont Hotel, and I checked in. I'd put on my red hunting cap
when I was in the cab, just for the hell of it, but I took it off before I checked in. I
didn't want to look like a screwball or something. Which is really ironic. I didn't
know then that the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons. Screwballs all
over the place.



                                            35
 They gave me this very crumby room, with nothing to look out of the window at
except the other side of the hotel. I didn't care much. I was too depressed to care
whether I had a good view or not. The bellboy that showed me to the room was
this very old guy around sixty-five. He was even more depressing than the room
was. He was one of those bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to
cover up the baldness. I'd rather be bald than do that. Anyway, what a gorgeous
job for a guy around sixty-five years old. Carrying people's suitcases and waiting
around for a tip. I suppose he wasn't too intelligent or anything, but it was terrible
anyway.
   After he left, I looked out the window for a while, with my coat on and all. I
didn't have anything else to do. You'd be surprised what was going on on the other
side of the hotel. They didn't even bother to pull their shades down. I saw one guy,
a gray-haired, very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on, do something
you wouldn't believe me if I told you. First he put his suitcase on the bed. Then
he took out all these women's clothes, and put them on. Real women's clothes—
silk stockings, high-heeled shoes, brassière, and one of those corsets with the straps
hanging down and all. Then he put on this very tight black evening dress. I swear
to God. Then he started walking up and down the room, taking these very small
steps, the way a woman does, and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the
mirror. He was all alone, too. Unless somebody was in the bathroom—I couldn't
see that much. Then, in the window almost right over his, I saw a man and a woman
squirting water out of their mouths at each other. It probably was highballs, not
water, but I couldn't see what they had in their glasses. Anyway, first he'd take a
swallow and squirt it all over her, then she did it to him—they took turns, for God's
sake. You should've seen them. They were in hysterics the whole time, like it was
the funniest thing that ever happened. I'm not kidding, the hotel was lousy with
perverts. I was probably the only normal bastard in the whole place—and that isn't
saying much. I damn near sent a telegram to old Stradlater telling him to take the
first train to New York. He'd have been the king of the hotel.
   The trouble was, that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch, even if you
don't want it to be. For instance, that girl that was getting water squirted all over
her face, she was pretty good-looking. I mean that's my big trouble. In my mind,
I'm probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw. Sometimes I can think of very
crumby stuff I wouldn't mind doing if the opportunity came up. I can even see how
it might be quite a lot of fun, in a crumby way, and if you were both sort of drunk
and all, to get a girl and squirt water or something all over each other's face. The
thing is, though, I don't like the idea. It stinks, if you analyze it. I think if you
don't really like a girl, you shouldn't horse around with her at all, and if you do like
her, then you're supposed to like her face, and if you like her face, you ought to be
careful about doing crumby stuff to it, like squirting water all over it. It's really too
bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes. Girls aren't too much help,
either, when you start trying not to get too crumby, when you start trying not to
spoil anything really good. I knew this one girl, a couple of years ago, that was even
crumbier than I was. Boy, was she crumby! We had a lot of fun, though, for a while,



in a crumby way. Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never
know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then
I break them right away. Last year I made a rule that I was going to quit horsing
around with girls that, deep down, gave me a pain in the ass. I broke it, though,
the same week I made it—the same night, as a matter of fact. I spent the whole
night necking with a terrible phony named Anne Louise Sherman. Sex is something
I just don't understand. I swear to God I don't.
   I started toying with the idea, while I kept standing there, of giving old Jane a
buzz—I mean calling her long distance at B.M., where she went, instead of calling
up her mother to find out when she was coming home. You weren't supposed to call
students up late at night, but I had it all figured out. I was going to tell whoever
answered the phone that I was her uncle. I was going to say her aunt had just got
killed in a car accident and I had to speak to her immediately. It would've worked,
too. The only reason I didn't do it was because I wasn't in the mood. If you're not
in the mood, you can't do that stuff right.
   After a while I sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarettes. I was feeling
pretty horny. I have to admit it. Then, all of a sudden, I got this idea. I took out
my wallet and started looking for this address a guy I met at a party last summer,
that went to Princeton, gave me. Finally I found it. It was all a funny color from my
wallet, but you could still read it. It was the address of this girl that wasn't exactly
a whore or anything but that didn't mind doing it once in a while, this Princeton
guy told me. He brought her to a dance at Princeton once, and they nearly kicked
him out for bringing her. She used to be a burlesque stripper or something. Anyway,
I went over to the phone and gave her a buzz. Her name was Faith Cavendish, and
she lived at the Stanford Arms Hotel on Sixty-fifth and Broadway. A dump, no
doubt.
   For a while, I didn t think she was home or something. Nobody kept answering.
Then, finally, somebody picked up the phone.
   “Hello?” I said. I made my voice quite deep so that she wouldn't suspect my age
or anything. I have a pretty deep voice anyway.
   “Hello,” this woman's voice said. None too friendly, either.
   “Is this Miss Faith Cavendish?”
   “Who's this?” she said. “Who's calling me up at this crazy goddam hour?”
   That sort of scared me a little bit. “Well, I know it's quite late,” I said, in this
very mature voice and all. “I hope you'll forgive me, but I was very anxious to get
in touch with you.” I said it suave as hell. I really did.
   “Who is this?” she said.
   “Well, you don't know me, but I'm a friend of Eddie Birdsell's. He suggested that
if I were in town sometime, we ought to get together for a cocktail or two.”
   “Who? You're a friend of who?” Boy, she was a real tigress over the phone. She
was damn near yelling at me.
   “Edmund Birdsell. Eddie Birdsell,” I said. I couldn't remember if his name was
Edmund or Edward. I only met him once, at a goddam stupid party.




                                          37
 “I don't know anybody by that name, Jack. And if you think I enjoy bein' woke
up in the middle—”
   “Eddie Bird sell? From Princeton?” I said.
   You could tell she was running the name over in her mind and all.
   “Birdsell, Birdsell . . . from Princeton . . . Princeton College?”
   “That's right,” I said.
   “You from Princeton College?”
   “Well, approximately.”
   “Oh . . . How is Eddie?” she said. “This is certainly a peculiar time to call a
person up, though. Jesus Christ.”
   “He's fine. He asked to be remembered to you.”
   “Well, thank you. Remember me to him,” she said. “He's a grand person. What's
he doing now?” She was getting friendly as hell, all of a sudden.
   “Oh, you know. Same old stuff,” I said. How the hell did I know what he was
doing? I hardly knew the guy. I didn't even know if he was still at Princeton.
“Look,” I said. “Would you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere?”
   “By any chance do you have any idea what time it is?” she said. “What's your
name, anyhow, may I ask?” She was getting an English accent, all of a sudden.
“You sound a little on the young side.”
   I laughed. “Thank you for the compliment,” I said— suave as hell. “Holden
Caulfield's my name.” I should've given her a phony name, but I didn't think of it.
   “Well, look, Mr. Cawffle. I'm not in the habit of making engagements in the
middle of the night. I'm a working gal.”
   “Tomorrow's Sunday,” I told her.
   “Well, anyway. I gotta get my beauty sleep. You know how it is.”
   “I thought we might have just one cocktail together. It isn't too late.”
   “Well. You're very sweet,” she said. “Where ya callin' from? Where ya at now,
anyways?”
   “Me? I'm in a phone booth.”
   “Oh,” she said. Then there was this very long pause. “Well, I'd like awfully to get
together with you sometime, Mr. Cawffle. You sound very attractive. You sound
like a very attractive person. But it is late.”
   “I could come up to your place.”
   “Well, ordinary, I'd say grand. I mean I'd love to have you drop up for a cocktail,
but my roommate happens to be ill. She's been laying here all night without a wink
of sleep. She just this minute closed her eyes and all. I mean.”
   “Oh. That's too bad.”
   “Where ya stopping at? Perhaps we could get together for cocktails tomorrow.”
   “I can't make it tomorrow,” I said. “Tonight's the only time I can make it.” What
a dope I was. I shouldn't've said that.
   “Oh. Well, I'm awfully sorry.”
   “I'll say hello to Eddie for you.”
   “Willya do that? I hope you enjoy your stay in New York. It's a grand place.”
   “I know it is. Thanks. Good night,” I said. Then I hung up.



                                         38
 Boy, I real ly fouled that up. I should've at least made it for cocktails or something.

It was still pretty early. I'm not sure what time it was, but it wasn't too late.
The one thing I hate to do is go to bed when I'm not even tired. So I opened my
suitcases and took out a clean shirt, and then I went in the bathroom and washed
and changed my shirt. What I thought I'd do, I thought I'd go downstairs and see
what the hell was going on in the Lavender Room. They had this night club, the
Lavender Room, in the hotel.
   While I was changing my shirt, I damn near gave my kid sister Phoebe a buzz,
though. I certainly felt like talking to her on the phone. Somebody with sense and
all. But I couldn't take a chance on giving her a buzz, because she was only a little
kid and she wouldn't have been up, let alone anywhere near the phone. I thought
of maybe hanging up if my parents answered, but that wouldn't've worked, either.
They'd know it was me. My mother always knows it's me. She's psychic. But I
certainly wouldn't have minded shooting the crap with old Phoebe for a while.
   You should see her. You never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole
life. She's really smart. I mean she's had all A's ever since she started school. As a
matter of fact, I'm the only dumb one in the family. My brother D.B.'s a writer and
all, and my brother Allie, the one that died, that I told you about, was a wizard.
I'm the only really dumb one. But you ought to see old Phoebe. She has this sort
of red hair, a little bit like Allie's was, that's very short in the summertime. In the
summertime, she sticks it behind her ears. She has nice, pretty little ears. In the
wintertime, it's pretty long, though. Sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes
she doesn't. It's really nice, though. She's only ten. She's quite skinny, like me, but
nice skinny. Roller-skate skinny. I watched her once from the window when she was
crossing over Fifth Avenue to go to the park, and that's what she is, roller-skate
skinny. You'd like her. I mean if you tell old Phoebe something, she knows exactly
what the hell you're talking about. I mean you can even take her anywhere with
you. If you take her to a lousy movie, for instance, she knows it's a lousy movie. If
you take her to a pretty good movie, she knows it's a pretty good movie. D.B. and
I took her to see this French movie, The Baker's Wife, with Raimu in it. It killed
her. Her favorite is The 39 Steps, though, with Robert Donat. She knows the whole
goddam movie by heart, because I've taken her to see it about ten times. When
old Donat comes up to this Scotch farmhouse, for instance, when he's running away
from the cops and all, Phoebe'll say right out loud in the movie—right when the
Scotch guy in the picture says it—“Can you eat the herring?” She knows all the talk
by heart. And when this professor in the picture, that's really a German spy, sticks
up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing, to show Robert Donat, old
Phoebe beats him to it—she holds up her little finger at me in the dark, right in
front of my face. She's all right. You'd like her. The only trouble is, she's a little too
affectionate sometimes. She's very emotional, for a child. She really is. Something
else she does, she writes books all the time. Only, she doesn't finish them. They're



                                           39

all about some kid named Hazel Weatherfield—only old Phoebe spells it “Hazle.”
Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective. She's supposed to be an orphan, but her
old man keeps showing up. Her old man's always a “tall attractive gentleman about
20 years of age.” That kills me. Old Phoebe. I swear to God you'd like her. She
was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid. When she was a very tiny little
kid, I and Allie used to take her to the park with us, especially on Sundays. Allie
had this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on Sundays, and we used to
take old Phoebe with us. She'd wear white gloves and walk right between us, like a
lady and all. And when Allie and I were having some conversation about things in
general, old Phoebe'd be listening. Sometimes you'd forget she was around, because
she was such a little kid, but she'd let you know. She'd interrupt you all the time.
She'd give Allie or I a push or something, and say, “Who? Who said that? Bobby
or the lady?” And we'd tell her who said it, and she'd say, “Oh,” and go right on
listening and all. She killed Allie, too. I mean he liked her, too. She's ten now, and
not such a tiny little kid any more, but she still kills everybody—everybody with
any sense, anyway.
   Anyway, she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone. But I
was too afraid my parents would answer, and then they'd find out I was in New
York and kicked out of Pencey and all. So I just finished putting on my shirt. Then
I got all ready and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on.
   Except for a few pimpy-looking guys, and a few whory-looking blondes, the lobby
was pretty empty. But you could hear the band playing in the Lavender Room,
and so I went in there. It wasn't very crowded, but they gave me a lousy table
anyway—way in the back. I should've waved a buck under the head-waiter's nose.
In New York, boy, money really talks—I'm not kidding.
   The band was putrid. Buddy Singer. Very brassy, but not good brassy—corny
brassy. Also, there were very few people around my age in the place. In fact, nobody
was around my age. They were mostly old, show-offy-looking guys with their dates.
Except at the table right next to me. At the table right next to me, there were these
three girls around thirty or so. The whole three of them were pretty ugly, and they
all had on the kind of hats that you knew they didn't really live in New York, but
one of them, the blonde one, wasn't too bad. She was sort of cute, the blonde one,
and I started giving her the old eye a little bit, but just then the waiter came up for
my order. I ordered a Scotch and soda, and told him not to mix it—I said it fast
as hell, because if you hem and haw, they think you're under twenty-one and won't
sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had trouble with him anyway, though. “I'm sorry,
sir,” he said, “but do you have some verification of your age? Your driver's license,
perhaps?”
   I gave him this very cold stare, like he'd insulted the hell out of me, and asked
him, “Do I look like I'm under twenty-one?”
   “I'm sorry, sir, but we have our—”
   “Okay, okay,” I said. I figured the hell with it. “Bring me a Coke.” He started
to go away, but I called him back. “Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?”




                                          40

I asked him. I asked him very nicely and all. “I can't sit in a corny place like this
cold sober. Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?”
   “I'm very sorry, sir . . . ” he said, and beat it on me. I didn't hold it against him,
though. They lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor. I'm a goddam
minor.
   I started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again. That is, the
blonde one. The other two were strictly from hunger. I didn't do it crudely, though.
I just gave all three of them this very cool glance and all. What they did, though,
the three of them, when I did it, they started giggling like morons. They probably
thought I was too young to give anybody the once-over. That annoyed hell out of
me— you'd've thought I wanted to marry them or something. I should've given
them the freeze, after they did that, but the trouble was, I really felt like dancing.
I'm very fond of dancing, sometimes, and that was one of the times. So all of a
sudden, I sort of leaned over and said, “Would any of you girls care to dance?” I
didn't ask them crudely or anything. Very suave, in fact. But God damn it, they
thought that was a panic, too. They started giggling some more. I'm not kidding,
they were three real morons. “C'mon,” I said. “I'll dance with you one at a time.
All right? How 'bout it? C'mon!” I really felt like dancing.
   Finally, the blonde one got up to dance with me, because you could tell I was
really talking to her, and we walked out to the dance floor. The other two grools
nearly had hysterics when we did. I certainly must've been very hard up to even
bother with any of them.
   But it was worth it. The blonde was some dancer. She was one of the best dancers
I ever danced with. I'm not kidding, some of these very stupid girls can really knock
you out on a dance floor. You take a really smart girl, and half the time she's trying
to lead you around the dance floor, or else she's such a lousy dancer, the best thing
to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her.
   “You really can dance,” I told the blonde one. “You oughta be a pro. I mean it.
I danced with a pro once, and you're twice as good as she was. Did you ever hear
of Marco and Miranda?”
   “What?” she said. She wasn't even listening to me. She was looking all around
the place.
   “I said did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?”
   “I don't know. No. I don't know.”
   “Well, they're dancers, she's a dancer. She's not too hot, though. She does
everything she's supposed to, but she's not so hot anyway. You know when a girl's
really a terrific dancer?”
   “Wudga say?” she said. She wasn't listening to me, even. Her mind was wander-
ing all over the place.
   “I said do you know when a girl's really a terrific dancer?”
   “Uh-uh.”
   “Well—where I have my hand on your back. If I think there isn't anything
underneath my hand—no can, no legs, no feet, no anything—then the girl's really
a terrific dancer.”



                                           41

  She wasn't listening, though. So I ignored her for a while. We just danced. God,
could that dopey girl dance. Buddy Singer and his stinking band was playing “Just
One of Those Things” and even they couldn't ruin it entirely. It's a swell song. I
didn't try any trick stuff while we danced—I hate a guy that does a lot of show-off
tricky stuff on the dance floor—but I was moving her around plenty, and she stayed
with me. The funny thing is, I thought she was enjoying it, too, till all of a sudden
she came out with this very dumb remark. “I and my girl friends saw Peter Lorre
last night,” she said. “The movie actor. In person. He was buyin' a newspaper.
He's cute.”
   “You're lucky,” I told her. “You're really lucky. You know that?” She was really
a moron. But what a dancer. I could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a
kiss on the top of her dopey head—you know— right where the part is, and all. She
got sore when I did it.
   “Hey! What's the idea?”
   “Nothing. No idea. You really can dance,” I said. “I have a kid sister that's only
in the goddam fourth grade. You're about as good as she is, and she can dance
better than anybody living or dead.”
   “Watch your language, if you don't mind.”
   What a lady, boy. A queen, for Chrissake.
   “Where you girls from?” I asked her.
   She didn't answer me, though. She was busy looking around for old Peter Lorre
to show up, I guess.
   “Where you girls from?” I asked her again.
   “What?” she said.
   “Where you girls from? Don't answer if you don't feel like it. I don't want you
to strain yourself.”
   “Seattle, Washington,” she said. She was doing me a big favor to tell me.
   “You're a very good conversationalist,” I told her. “You know that?”
   “What?”
   I let it drop. It was over her head, anyway. “Do you feel like jitterbugging a little
bit, if they play a fast one? Not corny jitterbug, not jump or anything—just nice
and easy. Everybody'll all sit down when they play a fast one, except the old guys
and the fat guys, and we'll have plenty of room. Okay?”
   “It's immaterial to me,” she said. “Hey—how old are you, anyhow?”
   That annoyed me, for some reason. “Oh, Christ. Don't spoil it,” I said. “I'm
twelve, for Chrissake. I'm big for my age.”
   “Listen. I toleja about that. I don't like that type language,” she said. “If you're
gonna use that type language, I can go sit down with my girl friends, you know.”
   I apologized like a madman, because the band was starting a fast one. She started
jitterbugging with me— but just very nice and easy, not corny. She was really good.
All you had to do was touch her. And when she turned around, her pretty little
butt twitched so nice and all. She knocked me out. I mean it. I was half in love
with her by the time we sat down. That's the thing about girls. Every time they
do something pretty, even if they're not much to look at, or even if they're sort of



                                          42

stupid, you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you
are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They can drive you crazy. They really can.
   They didn't invite me to sit down at their table— mostly because they were too
ignorant—but I sat down anyway. The blonde I'd been dancing with's name was
Bernice something—Crabs or Krebs. The two ugly ones' names were Marty and
Laverne. I told them my name was Jim Steele, just for the hell of it. Then I tried to
get them in a little intelligent conversation, but it was practically impossible. You
had to twist their arms. You could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three
of them. And the whole three of them kept looking all around the goddam room,
like as if they expected a flock of goddam movie stars to come in any minute. They
probably thought movie stars always hung out in the Lavender Room when they
came to New York, instead of the Stork Club or El Morocco and all. Anyway, it
took me about a half hour to find out where they all worked and all in Seattle. They
all worked in the same insurance office. I asked them if they liked it, but do you
think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three dopes? I thought the
two ugly ones, Marty and Laverne, were sisters, but they got very insulted when I
asked them. You could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the other one,
and you couldn't blame them, but it was very amusing anyway.
   I danced with them all—the whole three of them—one at a time. The one ugly
one, Laverne, wasn't too bad a dancer, but the other one, old Marty, was murder.
Old Marty was like dragging the Statue of Liberty around the floor. The only way
I could even half enjoy myself dragging her around was if I amused myself a little.
So I told her I just saw Gary Cooper, the movie star, on the other side of the floor.
   “Where? ” she asked me—excited as hell. “Where? ”
   “Aw, you just missed him. He just went out. Why didn't you look when I told
you?”
   She practically stopped dancing, and started looking over everybody's heads to
see if she could see him. “Oh, shoot!” she said. I'd just about broken her heart— I
really had. I was sorry as hell I'd kidded her. Some people you shouldn't kid, even
if they deserve it.
   Here's what was very funny, though. When we got back to the table, old Marty
told the other two that Gary Cooper had just gone out. Boy, old Laverne and
Bernice nearly committed suicide when they heard that. They got all excited and
asked Marty if she'd seen him and all. Old Mart said she'd only caught a glimpse
of him. That killed me.
   The bar was closing up for the night, so I bought them all two drinks apiece quick
before it closed, and I ordered two more Cokes for myself. The goddam table was
lousy with glasses. The one ugly one, Laverne, kept kidding me because I was only
drinking Cokes. She had a sterling sense of humor. She and old Marty were drinking
Tom Collinses—in the middle of December, for God's sake. They didn't know any
better. The blonde one, old Bernice, was drinking bourbon and water. She was
really putting it away, too. The whole three of them kept looking for movie stars
the whole time. They hardly talked—even to each other. Old Marty talked more
than the other two. She kept saying these very corny, boring things, like calling



                                         43
the can the “little girls' room,” and she thought Buddy Singer's poor old beat-up
clarinet player was really terrific when he stood up and took a couple of ice-cold
hot licks. She called his clarinet a “licorice stick.” Was she corny. The other ugly
one, Laverne, thought she was a very witty type. She kept asking me to call up my
father and ask him what he was doing tonight. She kept asking me if my father had
a date or not. Four times she asked me that—she was certainly witty. Old Bernice,
the blonde one, didn't say hardly anything at all. Every time I'd ask her something,
she said “What?” That can get on your nerves after a while.
   All of a sudden, when they finished their drink, all three of them stood up on me
and said they had to get to bed. They said they were going to get up early to see
the first show at Radio City Music Hall. I tried to get them to stick around for a
while, but they wouldn't. So we said good-by and all. I told them I'd look them up
in Seattle sometime, if I ever got there, but I doubt if I ever will. Look them up, I
mean.
   With cigarettes and all, the check came to about thirteen bucks. I think they
should've at least of fered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them—I
wouldn't've let them, naturally, but they should've at least offered. I didn't care
much, though. They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all.
And that business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music
Hall depressed me. If somebody, some girl in an awful-looking hat, for instance,
comes all the way to New York—from Seattle, Washington, for God's sake—and
ends up getting up early in the morning to see the goddam first show at Radio City
Music Hall, it makes me so depressed I can't stand it. I'd've bought the whole three
of them a hundred drinks if only they hadn't told me that.
   I left the Lavender Room pretty soon after they did. They were closing it up
anyway, and the band had quit a long time ago. In the first place, it was one of
those places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance
with, or unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just Cokes. There isn't
any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least
buy some liquor and get drunk. Or unless you're with some girl that really knocks
you out.


11
All of a sudden, on my way out to the lobby, I got old Jane Gallagher on the brain
again. I got her on, and I couldn't get her off. I sat down in this vomity-looking
chair in the lobby and thought about her and Stradlater sitting in that goddam
Ed Banky's car, and though I was pretty damn sure old Stradlater hadn't given
her the time—I know old Jane like a book—I still couldn't get her off my brain. I
knew her like a book. I really did. I mean, besides checkers, she was quite fond of
all athletic sports, and after I got to know her, the whole summer long we played
tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon. I really got
to know her quite intimately. I don't mean it was anything physical or anything—it




                                         44

wasn't—but we saw each other all the time. You don't always have to get too sexy
to get to know a girl.
   The way I met her, this Doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve
himself on our lawn, and my mother got very irritated about it. She called up Jane's
mother and made a big stink about it. My mother can make a very big stink about
that kind of stuff. Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Jane laying
on her stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her. I
knew she lived in the house next to ours, but I'd never conversed with her before or
anything. She gave me the big freeze when I said hello that day, though. I had a
helluva time convincing her that I didn't give a good goddam where her dog relieved
himself. He could do it in the living room, for all I cared. Anyway, after that, Jane
and I got to be friends and all. I played golf with her that same afternoon. She lost
eight balls, I remember. Eight. I had a terrible time getting her to at least open her
eyes when she took a swing at the ball. I improved her game immensely, though.
I'm a very good golfer. If I told you what I go around in, you probably wouldn't
believe me. I almost was once in a movie short, but I changed my mind at the last
minute. I figured that anybody that hates the movies as much as I do, I'd be a
phony if I let them stick me in a movie short.
   She was a funny girl, old Jane. I wouldn't exactly describe her as strictly beautiful.
She knocked me out, though. She was sort of muckle-mouthed. I mean when she
was talking and she got excited about something, her mouth sort of went in about
fifty directions, her lips and all. That killed me. And she never really closed it all
the way, her mouth. It was always just a little bit open, especially when she got
in her golf stance, or when she was reading a book. She was always reading, and
she read very good books. She read a lot of poetry and all. She was the only one,
outside my family, that I ever showed Allie's baseball mitt to, with all the poems
written on it. She'd never met Allie or anything, because that was her first summer
in Maine—before that, she went to Cape Cod—but I told her quite a lot about him.
She was interested in that kind of stuff.
   My mother didn't like her too much. I mean my mother always thought Jane and
her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn't say hello. My
mother saw them in the village a lot, because Jane used to drive to market with
her mother in this LaSalle convertible they had. My mother didn't think Jane was
pretty, even. I did, though. I just liked the way she looked, that's all.
   I remember this one afternoon. It was the only time old Jane and I ever got close
to necking, even. It was a Saturday and it was raining like a bastard out, and I
was over at her house, on the porch—they had this big screened-in porch. We were
playing checkers. I used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn't take her
kings out of the back row. But I didn't kid her much, though. You never wanted
to kid Jane too much. I think I really like it best when you can kid the pants off
a girl when the opportunity arises, but it's a funny thing. The girls I like best are
the ones I never feel much like kidding. Sometimes I think they'd like it if you
kidded them—in fact, I know they would—but it's hard to get started, once you've
known them a pretty long time and never kidded them. Anyway, I was telling you



                                           45

about that afternoon Jane and I came close to necking. It was raining like hell and
we were out on her porch, and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was
married to came out on the porch and asked Jane if there were any cigarettes in the
house. I didn't know him too well or anything, but he looked like the kind of guy
that wouldn't talk to you much unless he wanted something off you. He had a lousy
personality. Anyway, old Jane wouldn't answer him when he asked her if she knew
where there was any cigarettes. So the guy asked her again, but she still wouldn't
answer him. She didn't even look up from the game. Finally the guy went inside the
house. When he did, I asked Jane what the hell was going on. She wouldn't even
answer me, then. She made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the
game and all. Then all of a sudden, this tear plopped down on the checkerboard.
On one of the red squares—boy, I can still see it. She just rubbed it into the board
with her finger. I don't know why, but it bothered hell out of me. So what I did was,
I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I could sit down next to
her—I practically sat down in her lap, as a matter of fact. Then she really started to
cry, and the next thing I knew, I was kissing her all over—anywhere—her eyes, her
nose, her forehead, her eyebrows and all, her ears—her whole face except her mouth
and all. She sort of wouldn't let me get to her mouth. Anyway, it was the closest we
ever got to necking. After a while, she got up and went in and put on this red and
white sweater she had, that knocked me out, and we went to a goddam movie. I
asked her, on the way, if Mr. Cudahy—that was the booze hound's name—had ever
tried to get wise with her. She was pretty young, but she had this terrific figure,
and I wouldn't've put it past that Cudahy bastard. She said no, though. I never
did find out what the hell was the matter. Some girls you practically never find out
what's the matter.
   I don't want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something, just
because we never necked or horsed around much. She wasn't. I held hands with
her all the time, for instance. That doesn't sound like much, I realize, but she was
terrific to hold hands with. Most girls if you hold hands with them, their goddam
hand dies on you, or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the
time, as if they were afraid they'd bore you or something. Jane was different. We'd
get into a goddam movie or something, and right away we'd start holding hands,
and we wouldn't quit till the movie was over. And without changing the position or
making a big deal out of it. You never even worried, with Jane, whether your hand
was sweaty or not. All you knew was, you were happy. You really were.
   One other thing I just thought of. One time, in this movie, Jane did something
that just about knocked me out. The newsreel was on or something, and all of a
sudden I felt this hand on the back of my neck, and it was Jane's. It was a funny
thing to do. I mean she was quite young and all, and most girls if you see them
putting their hand on the back of somebody's neck, they're around twenty-five or
thirty and usually they're doing it to their husband or their little kid—I do it to my
kid sister Phoebe once in a while, for instance. But if a girl's quite young and all
and she does it, it's so pretty it just about kills you.




                                         46

  Anyway, that's what I was thinking about while I sat in that vomity-looking chair
in the lobby. Old Jane. Every time I got to the part about her out with Stradlater
in that damn Ed Banky's car, it almost drove me crazy. I knew she wouldn't let
him get to first base with her, but it drove me crazy anyway. I don't even like to
talk about it, if you want to know the truth.
   There was hardly anybody in the lobby any more. Even all the whory-looking
blondes weren't around any more, and all of a sudden I felt like getting the hell out
of the place. It was too depressing. And I wasn't tired or anything. So I went up
to my room and put on my coat. I also took a look out the window to see if all
the perverts were still in action, but the lights and all were out now. I went down
in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to Ernie's.
Ernie's is this night club in Greenwich Village that my brother D.B. used to go to
quite frequently before he went out to Hollywood and prostituted himself. He used
to take me with him once in a while. Ernie's a big fat colored guy that plays the
piano. He's a terrific snob and he won't hardly even talk to you unless you're a big
shot or a celebrity or something, but he can really play the piano. He's so good
he's almost corny, in fact. I don't exactly know what I mean by that, but I mean
it. I certainly like to hear him play, but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam
piano over. I think it's because sometimes when he plays, he sounds like the kind
of guy that won't talk to you unless you're a big shot.

The cab I had was a real old one that smelled like someone'd just tossed his cookies
in it. I always get those vomity kind of cabs if I go anywhere late at night. What
made it worse, it was so quiet and lonesome out, even though it was Saturday night.
I didn't see hardly anybody on the street. Now and then you just saw a man and
a girl crossing a street, with their arms around each other's waists and all, or a
bunch of hoodlumy-looking guys and their dates, all of them laughing like hyenas at
something you could bet wasn't funny. New York's terrible when somebody laughs
on the street very late at night. You can hear it for miles. It makes you feel so
lonesome and depressed. I kept wishing I could go home and shoot the bull for a
while with old Phoebe. But finally, after I was riding a while, the cab driver and I
sort of struck up a conversation. His name was Horwitz. He was a much better guy
than the other driver I'd had. Anyway, I thought maybe he might know about the
ducks.
  “Hey, Horwitz,” I said. “You ever pass by the lagoon in Central Park? Down by
Central Park South?”
  “The what?”
  “The lagoon. That little lake, like, there. Where the ducks are. You know.”
  “Yeah, what about it?”
  “Well, you know the ducks that swim around in it? In the springtime and all?
Do you happen to know where they go in the wintertime, by any chance?”
  “Where who goes?”



                                         47
  “The ducks. Do you know, by any chance? I mean does somebody come around
in a truck or something and take them away, or do they fly away by themselves—go
south or something?”
   Old Horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me. He was a very impatient-
type guy. He wasn't a bad guy, though. “How the hell should I know?” he said.
“How the hell should I know a stupid thing like that?”
   “Well, don't get sore about it,” I said. He was sore about it or something.
   “Who's sore? Nobody's sore.”
   I stopped having a conversation with him, if he was going to get so damn touchy
about it. But he started it up again himself. He turned all the way around again,
and said, “The fish don't go no place. They stay right where they are, the fish.
Right in the goddam lake.”
   “The fish—that's different. The fish is different. I'm talking about the ducks,” I
said.
   “What's dif ferent about it? Nothin's dif ferent about it,” Horwitz said. Every-
thing he said, he sounded sore about something. “It's tougher for the fish, the winter
and all, than it is for the ducks, for Chrissake. Use your head, for Chrissake.”
   I didn't say anything for about a minute. Then I said, “All right. What do they
do, the fish and all, when that whole little lake's a solid block of ice, people skating
on it and all?”
   Old Horwitz turned around again. “What the hellaya mean what do they do?”
he yelled at me. “They stay right where they are, for Chrissake.”
   “They can't just ignore the ice. They can't just ignore it.”
   “Who's ignoring it? Nobody's ignor ing it!” Horwitz said. He got so damn excited
and all, I was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something.
“They live right in the goddam ice. It's their nature, for Chrissake. They get frozen
right in one position for the whole winter.”
   “Yeah? What do they eat, then? I mean if they're frozen solid, they can't swim
around looking for food and all.”
   “Their bodies, for Chrissake—what'sa matter with ya? Their bodies take in nu-
trition and all, right through the goddam seaweed and crap that's in the ice. They
got their pores open the whole time. That's their nature, for Chrissake. See what I
mean?” He turned way the hell around again to look at me.
   “Oh,” I said. I let it drop. I was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi
up or something. Besides, he was such a touchy guy, it wasn't any pleasure dis-
cussing anything with him. “Would you care to stop off and have a drink with me
somewhere?” I said.
   He didn't answer me, though. I guess he was still thinking. I asked him again,
though. He was a pretty good guy. Quite amusing and all.
   “I ain't got no time for no liquor, bud,” he said. “How the hell old are you,
anyways? Why ain'tcha home in bed?”
   “I'm not tired.”
   When I got out in front of Ernie's and paid the fare, old Horwitz brought up the
fish again. He certainly had it on his mind. “Listen,” he said. “If you was a fish,



                                          48

Mother Nature'd take care of you, wouldn't she? Right? You don't think them fish
just die when it gets to be winter, do ya?”
   “No, but—”
   “You're goddam right they don't,” Horwitz said, and drove off like a bat out of
hell. He was about the touchiest guy I ever met. Everything you said made him
sore.
   Even though it was so late, old Ernie's was jampacked. Mostly with prep school
jerks and college jerks. Almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for
Christmas vacation than the schools I go to. You could hardly check your coat, it
was so crowded. It was pretty quiet, though, because Ernie was playing the piano. It
was supposed to be something holy, for God's sake, when he sat down at the piano.
Nobody's that good. About three couples, besides me, were waiting for tables, and
they were all shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old Ernie while he
played. He had a big damn mirror in front of the piano, with this big spotlight on
him, so that everybody could watch his face while he played. You couldn't see his
fingers while he played—just his big old face. Big deal. I'm not too sure what the
name of the song was that he was playing when I came in, but whatever it was,
he was really stinking it up. He was putting all these dumb, show-offy ripples in
the high notes, and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives me a pain in the ass.
You should've heard the crowd, though, when he was finished. You would've puked.
They went mad. They were exactly the same morons that laugh like hyenas in the
movies at stuff that isn't funny. I swear to God, if I were a piano player or an actor
or something and all those dopes thought I was terrific, I'd hate it. I wouldn't even
want them to clap for me. People always clap for the wrong things. If I were a
piano player, I'd play it in the goddam closet. Anyway, when he was finished, and
everybody was clapping their heads off, old Ernie turned around on his stool and
gave this very phony, humble bow. Like as if he was a helluva humble guy, besides
being a terrific piano player. It was very phony—I mean him being such a big snob
and all. In a funny way, though, I felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished.
I don't even think he knows any more when he's playing right or not. It isn't all
his fault. I partly blame all those dopes that clap their heads off—they'd foul up
anybody, if you gave them a chance. Anyway, it made me feel depressed and lousy
again, and I damn near got my coat back and went back to the hotel, but it was
too early and I didn't feel much like being all alone.
   They finally got me this stinking table, right up against a wall and behind a
goddam post, where you couldn't see anything. It was one of those tiny little tables
that if the people at the next table don't get up to let you by—and they never
do, the bastards—you practically have to climb into your chair. I ordered a Scotch
and soda, which is my favorite drink, next to frozen Daiquiris. If you were only
around six years old, you could get liquor at Ernie's, the place was so dark and all,
and besides, nobody cared how old you were. You could even be a dope fiend and
nobody'd care.
   I was surrounded by jerks. I'm not kidding. At this other tiny table, right to
my left, practically on top of me, there was this funny-looking guy and this funny-



                                         49
looking girl. They were around my age, or maybe just a little older. It was funny.
You could see they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast.
I listened to their conversation for a while, because I didn't have anything else to
do. He was telling her about some pro football game he'd seen that afternoon. He
gave her every single goddam play in the whole game—I'm not kidding. He was
the most boring guy I ever listened to. And you could tell his date wasn't even
interested in the goddam game, but she was even funnier-looking than he was, so
I guess she had to listen. Real ugly girls have it tough. I feel so sorry for them
sometimes. Sometimes I can't even look at them, especially if they're with some
dopey guy that's telling them all about a goddam football game. On my right, the
conversation was even worse, though. On my right there was this very Joe Yale-
looking guy, in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty-looking Tattersall vests. All
those Ivy League bastards look alike. My father wants me to go to Yale, or maybe
Princeton, but I swear, I wouldn't go to one of those Ivy League colleges, if I was
dying, for God's sake. Anyway, this Joe Yale-looking guy had a terrific-looking girl
with him. Boy, she was good-looking. But you should've heard the conversation
they were having. In the first place, they were both slightly crocked. What he was
doing, he was giving her a feel under the table, and at the same time telling her
all about some guy in his dorm that had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly
committed suicide. His date kept saying to him, “How hor rible . . . Don't, darling.
Please, don't. Not here.” Imagine giving somebody a feel and telling them about a
guy committing suicide at the same time! They killed me.
   I certainly began to feel like a prize horse's ass, though, sitting there all by myself.
There wasn't anything to do except smoke and drink. What I did do, though, I told
the waiter to ask old Ernie if he'd care to join me for a drink. I told him to tell
him I was D.B.'s brother. I don't think he ever even gave him my message, though.
Those bastards never give your message to anybody.
   All of a sudden, this girl came up to me and said, “Holden Caulfield!” Her name
was Lillian Simmons. My brother D.B. used to go around with her for a while. She
had very big knockers.
   “Hi,” I said. I tried to get up, naturally, but it was some job getting up, in a
place like that. She had some Navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker
up his ass.
   “How marvelous to see you!” old Lillian Simmons said. Strictly a phony. “How's
your big brother?” That's all she really wanted to know.
   “He's fine. He's in Hollywood.”
   “In Hol lywood! How marv elous! What's he doing?”
   “I don't know. Writing,” I said. I didn't feel like discussing it. You could tell she
thought it was a big deal, his being in Hollywood. Almost everybody does. Mostly
people who've never read any of his stories. It drives me crazy, though.
   “How exciting,” old Lillian said. Then she introduced me to the Navy guy. His
name was Commander Blop or something. He was one of those guys that think
they're being a pansy if they don't break around forty of your fingers when they
shake hands with you. God, I hate that stuff. “Are you all alone, baby?” old Lillian



                                            50
asked me. She was blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle. You could tell
she liked to block up a lot of traffic. This waiter was waiting for her to move out
of the way, but she didn't even notice him. It was funny. You could tell the waiter
didn't like her much, you could tell even the Navy guy didn't like her much, even
though he was dating her. And I didn't like her much. Nobody did. You had to
feel sort of sorry for her, in a way. “Don't you have a date, baby?” she asked me.
I was standing up now, and she didn't even tell me to sit down. She was the type
that keeps you standing up for hours. “Isn't he handsome?” she said to the Navy
guy. “Holden, you're getting handsomer by the minute.” The Navy guy told her to
come on. He told her they were blocking up the whole aisle. “Holden, come join
us,” old Lillian said. “Bring your drink.”
   “I was just leaving,” I told her. “I have to meet somebody.” You could tell she
was just trying to get in good with me. So that I'd tell old D.B. about it.
   “Well, you little so-and-so. All right for you. Tell your big brother I hate him,
when you see him.”
   Then she left. The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad to've met each
other. Which always kills me. I'm always saying “Glad to've met you” to somebody
I'm not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff,
though.
   After I'd told her I had to meet somebody, I didn't have any goddam choice
except to leave. I couldn't even stick around to hear old Ernie play something
halfway decent. But I certainly wasn't going to sit down at a table with old Lillian
Simmons and that Navy guy and be bored to death. So I left. It made me mad,
though, when I was getting my coat. People are always ruining things for you.


13
I walked all the way back to the hotel. Forty-one gorgeous blocks. I didn't do it
because I felt like walking or anything. It was more because I didn't feel like getting
in and out of another taxicab. Sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the
same way you get tired riding in elevators. All of a sudden, you have to walk, no
matter how far or how high up. When I was a kid, I used to walk all the way up to
our apartment very frequently. Twelve stories.
   You wouldn't even have known it had snowed at all. There was hardly any snow
on the sidewalks. But it was freezing cold, and I took my red hunting hat out of my
pocket and put it on—I didn't give a damn how I looked. I even put the earlaps
down. I wished I knew who'd swiped my gloves at Pencey, because my hands were
freezing. Not that I'd have done much about it even if I had known. I'm one of
these very yellow guys. I try not to show it, but I am. For instance, if I'd found out
at Pencey who'd stolen my gloves, I probably would've gone down to the crook's
room and said, “Okay. How 'bout handing over those gloves?” Then the crook that
had stolen them probably would've said, his voice very innocent and all, “What
gloves?” Then what I probably would've done, I'd have gone in his closet and found
the gloves somewhere. Hidden in his goddam galoshes or something, for instance.



                                          51
I'd have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said, “I suppose these
are your goddam gloves?” Then the crook probably would've given me this very
phony, innocent look, and said, “I never saw those gloves before in my life. If they're
yours, take 'em. I don't want the goddam things.” Then I probably would've just
stood there for about five minutes. I'd have the damn gloves right in my hand and
all, but I'd feel I ought to sock the guy in the jaw or something—break his goddam
jaw. Only, I wouldn't have the guts to do it. I'd just stand there, trying to look
tough. What I might do, I might say something very cutting and snotty, to rile him
up—instead of socking him in the jaw. Anyway if I did say something very cutting
and snotty, he'd probably get up and come over to me and say, “Listen, Caulfield.
Are you calling me a crook?” Then, instead of saying, “You're goddam right I am,
you dirty crooked bastard!” all I probably would've said would be, “All I know is
my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes.” Right away then, the guy would
know for sure that I wasn't going to take a sock at him, and he probably would've
said, “Listen. Let's get this straight. Are you calling me a thief?” Then I probably
would've said, “Nobody's calling anybody a thief. All I know is my gloves were in
your goddam galoshes.” It could go on like that for hours. Finally, though, I'd
leave his room without even taking a sock at him. I'd probably go down to the can
and sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror. Anyway, that's
what I thought about the whole way back to the hotel. It's no fun to he yellow.
Maybe I'm not all yellow. I don't know. I think maybe I'm just partly yellow and
partly the type that doesn't give much of a damn if they lose their gloves. One of
my troubles is, I never care too much when I lose something—it used to drive my
mother crazy when I was a kid. Some guys spend days looking for something they
lost. I never seem to have anything that if I lost it I'd care too much. Maybe that's
why I'm partly yellow. It's no excuse, though. It really isn't. What you should be
is not yellow at all. If you're supposed to sock somebody in the jaw, and you sort of
feel like doing it, you should do it. I'm just no good at it, though. I'd rather push
a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. I
hate fist fights. I don't mind getting hit so much—although I'm not crazy about it,
naturally—but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guy's face. I can't stand
looking at the other guy's face, is my trouble. It wouldn't be so bad if you could
both be blindfolded or something. It's a funny kind of yellowness, when you come
to think of it, but it's yellowness, all right. I'm not kidding myself.
   The more I thought about my gloves and my yellowness, the more depressed I got,
and I decided, while I was walking and all, to stop off and have a drink somewhere.
I'd only had three drinks at Ernie's, and I didn't even finish the last one. One thing
I have, it's a terrific capacity. I can drink all night and not even show it, if I'm
in the mood. Once, at the Whooton School, this other boy, Raymond Goldfarb,
and I bought a pint of Scotch and drank it in the chapel one Saturday night, where
nobody'd see us. He got stinking, but I hardly didn't even show it. I just got very
cool and nonchalant. I puked before I went to bed, but I didn't really have to—I
forced myself.




                                          52

 Anyway, before I got to the hotel, I started to go in this dumpy-looking bar, but
two guys came out, drunk as hell, and wanted to know where the subway was. One
of them was this very Cuban-looking guy, and he kept breathing his stinking breath
in my face while I gave him directions. I ended up not even going in the damn bar.
I just went back to the hotel.
   The whole lobby was empty. It smelled like fifty million dead cigars. It really
did. I wasn't sleepy or anything, but I was feeling sort of lousy. Depressed and all.
I almost wished I was dead.
   Then, all of a sudden, I got in this big mess.
   The first thing when I got in the elevator, the elevator guy said to me, “Innarested
in having a good time, fella? Or is it too late for you?”
   “How do you mean?” I said. I didn't know what he was driving at or anything.
   “Innarested in a little tail t'night?”
   “Me?” I said. Which was a very dumb answer, but it's quite embarrassing when
somebody comes right up and asks you a question like that.
   “How old are you, chief?” the elevator guy said.
   “Why?” I said. “Twenty-two.”
   “Uh huh. Well, how 'bout it? Y'innarested? Five bucks a throw. Fifteen bucks
the whole night.” He looked at his wrist watch. “Till noon. Five bucks a throw,
fifteen bucks till noon.”
   “Okay,” I said. It was against my principles and all, but I was feeling so depressed
I didn't even think. That's the whole trouble. When you're feeling very depressed,
you can't even think.
   “Okay what? A throw, or till noon? I gotta know.”
   “Just a throw.”
   “Okay, what room ya in?”
   I looked at the red thing with my number on it, on my key. “Twelve twenty-two,”
I said. I was already sort of sorry I'd let the thing start rolling, but it was too late
now.
   “Okay. I'll send a girl up in about fifteen minutes.” He opened the doors and I
got out.
   “Hey, is she good-looking?” I asked him. “I don't want any old bag.”
   “No old bag. Don't worry about it, chief.”
   “Who do I pay?”
   “Her,” he said. “Let's go, chief.” He shut the doors, practically right in my face.
   I went to my room and put some water on my hair, but you can't really comb
a crew cut or anything. Then I tested to see if my breath stank from so many
cigarettes and the Scotch and sodas I drank at Ernie's. All you do is hold your hand
under your mouth and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils. It didn't seem
to stink much, but I brushed my teeth anyway. Then I put on another clean shirt.
I knew I didn't have to get all dolled up for a prostitute or anything, but it sort
of gave me something to do. I was a little nervous. I was starting to feel pretty
sexy and all, but I was a little nervous anyway. If you want to know the truth, I'm
a virgin. I really am. I've had quite a few opportunities to lose my virginity and



                                          53
all, but I've never got around to it yet. Something always happens. For instance, if
you're at a girl's house, her parents always come home at the wrong time—or you're
afraid they will. Or if you're in the back seat of somebody's car, there's always
somebody's date in the front seat—some girl, I mean—that always wants to know
what's going on all over the whole goddam car. I mean some girl in front keeps
turning around to see what the hell's going on. Anyway, something always happens.
I came quite close to doing it a couple of times, though. One time in particular,
I remember. Something went wrong, though —I don't even remember what any
more. The thing is, most of the time when you're coming pretty close to doing it
with a girl—a girl that isn't a prostitute or anything, I mean—she keeps telling you
to stop. The trouble with me is, I stop. Most guys don't. I can't help it. You never
know whether they really want you to stop, or whether they're just scared as hell,
or whether they're just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it, the
blame'll be on you, not them. Anyway, I keep stopping. The trouble is, I get to
feeling sorry for them. I mean most girls are so dumb and all. After you neck them
for a while, you can really watch them losing their brains. You take a girl when she
really gets passionate, she just hasn't any brains. I don't know. They tell me to
stop, so I stop. I always wish I hadn't, after I take them home, but I keep doing it
anyway.
   Anyway, while I was putting on another clean shirt, I sort of figured this was
my big chance, in a way. I figured if she was a prostitute and all, I could get in
some practice on her, in case I ever get married or anything. I worry about that
stuff sometimes. I read this book once, at the Whooton School, that had this very
sophisticated, suave, sexy guy in it. Monsieur Blanchard was his name, I can still
remember. It was a lousy book, but this Blanchard guy was pretty good. He had
this big chteau and all on the Riviera, in Europe, and all he did in his spare time
was beat women off with a club. He was a real rake and all, but he knocked women
out. He said, in this one part, that a woman's body is like a violin and all, and
that it takes a terrific musician to play it right. It was a very corny book—I realize
that—but I couldn't get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway. In a way, that's
why I sort of wanted to get some practice in, in case I ever get married. Caulfield
and his Magic Violin, boy. It's corny, I realize, but it isn't too corny. I wouldn't
mind being pretty good at that stuff. Half the time, if you really want to know
the truth, when I'm horsing around with a girl, I have a helluva lot of trouble just
finding what I'm looking for, for God's sake, if you know what I mean. Take this
girl that I just missed having sexual intercourse with, that I told you about. It took
me about an hour to just get her goddam brassière off. By the time I did get it off,
she was about ready to spit in my eye.
   Anyway, I kept walking around the room, waiting for this prostitute to show up.
I kept hoping she'd be good-looking. I didn't care too much, though. I sort of just
wanted to get it over with. Finally, somebody knocked on the door, and when I
went to open it, I had my suitcase right in the way and I fell over it and damn near
broke my knee. I always pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something.




                                         54
When I opened the door, this prostitute was standing there. She had a polo coat
on, and no hat. She was sort of a blonde, but you could tell she dyed her hair. She
wasn't any old bag, though. “How do you do,” I said. Suave as hell, boy.
   “You the guy Maurice said?” she asked me. She didn't seem too goddam friendly.
   “Is he the elevator boy?”
   “Yeah,” she said.
   “Yes, I am. Come in, won't you?” I said. I was getting more and more nonchalant
as it went along. I really was.
   She came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed.
She had on a green dress underneath. Then she sort of sat down sideways on the
chair that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down.
She crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down. She was very
nervous, for a prostitute. She really was. I think it was because she was young as
hell. She was around my age. I sat down in the big chair, next to her, and offered
her a cigarette. “I don't smoke,” she said. She had a tiny little wheeny-whiny voice.
You could hardly hear her. She never said thank you, either, when you offered her
something. She just didn't know any better.
   “Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jim Steele,” I said.
   “Ya got a watch on ya?” she said. She didn't care what the hell my name was,
naturally. “Hey, how old are you, anyways?”
   “Me? Twenty-two.”
   “Like fun you are.”
   It was a funny thing to say. It sounded like a real kid. You'd think a prostitute
and all would say “Like hell you are” or “Cut the crap” instead of “Like fun you
are.”
   “How old are you?” I asked her.
   “Old enough to know better,” she said. She was really witty. “Ya got a watch on
ya?” she asked me again, and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head.
   I certainly felt peculiar when she did that. I mean she did it so sudden and all.
I know you're supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody gets up and pulls their
dress over their head, but I didn't. Sexy was about the last thing I was feeling. I
felt much more depressed than sexy.
   “Ya got a watch on ya, hey?”
   “No. No, I don't,” I said. Boy, was I feeling peculiar. “What's your name?” I
asked her. All she had on was this pink slip. It was really quite embarrassing. It
really was.
   “Sunny,” she said. “Let's go, hey.”
   “Don't you feel like talking for a while?” I asked her. It was a childish thing to
say, but I was feeling so damn peculiar. “Are you in a very big hurry?”
   She looked at me like I was a madman. “What the heck ya wanna talk about?”
she said.
   “I don't know. Nothing special. I just thought perhaps you might care to chat
for a while.”




                                         55

 She sat down in the chair next to the desk again. She didn't like it, though, you
could tell. She started jiggling her foot again—boy, she was a nervous girl.
   “Would you care for a cigarette now?” I said. I forgot she didn't smoke.
   “I don't smoke. Listen, if you're gonna talk, do it. I got things to do.”
   I couldn't think of anything to talk about, though. I thought of asking her how she
got to be a prostitute and all, but I was scared to ask her. She probably wouldn't've
told me anyway.
   “You don't come from New York, do you?” I said finally. That's all I could think
of.
   “Hollywood,” she said. Then she got up and went over to where she'd put her
dress down, on the bed. “Ya got a hanger? I don't want to get my dress all wrinkly.
It's brand-clean.”
   “Sure,” I said right away. I was only too glad to get up and do something. I took
her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her. It was funny. It made me feel
sort of sad when I hung it up. I thought of her going in a store and buying it, and
nobody in the store knowing she was a prostitute and all. The salesman probably
just thought she was a regular girl when she bought it. It made me feel sad as
hell—I don't know why exactly.
   I sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going. She was a lousy
conversationalist. “Do you work every night?” I asked her—it sounded sort of awful,
after I'd said it.
   “Yeah.” She was walking all around the room. She picked up the menu off the
desk and read it.
   “What do you do during the day?”
   She sort of shrugged her shoulders. She was pretty skinny. “Sleep. Go to the
show.” She put down the menu and looked at me. “Let's go, hey. I haven't got
all—”
   “Look,” I said. “I don't feel very much like myself tonight. I've had a rough night.
Honest to God. I'll pay you and all, but do you mind very much if we don't do it?
Do you mind very much?” The trouble was, I just didn't want to do it. I felt more
depressed than sexy, if you want to know the truth. She was depressing. Her green
dress hanging in the closet and all. And besides, I don't think I could ever do it
with somebody that sits in a stupid movie all day long. I really don't think I could.
   She came over to me, with this funny look on her face, like as if she didn't believe
me. “What'sa matter?” she said.
   “Nothing's the matter.” Boy, was I getting nervous. “The thing is, I had an
operation very recently.”
   “Yeah? Where?”
   “On my wuddayacallit—my clavichord.”
   “Yeah? Where the hell's that?”
   “The clavichord?” I said. “Well, actually, it's in the spinal canal. I mean it's
quite a ways down in the spinal canal.”
   “Yeah?” she said. “That's tough.” Then she sat down on my goddam lap.
“You're cute.”



                                          56
  She made me so nervous, I just kept on lying my head off. “I'm still recuperating,”
I told her.
   “You look like a guy in the movies. You know. Whosis. You know who I mean.
What the heck's his name?”
   “I don't know,” I said. She wouldn't get off my goddam lap.
   “Sure you know. He was in that pitcher with Mel-vine Douglas? The one that was
Mel-vine Douglas's kid brother? That falls off this boat? You know who I mean.”
   “No, I don't. I go to the movies as seldom as I can.”
   Then she started getting funny. Crude and all.
   “Do you mind cutting it out?” I said. “I'm not in the mood, I just told you. I
just had an operation.”
   She didn't get up from my lap or anything, but she gave me this terrifically dirty
look. “Listen,” she said. “I was sleepin' when that crazy Maurice woke me up. If
you think I'm—”
   “I said I'd pay you for coming and all. I really will. I have plenty of dough. It's
just that I'm practically just recovering from a very serious—”
   “What the heck did you tell that crazy Maurice you wanted a girl for, then? If
you just had a goddam operation on your goddam wuddayacallit. Huh? ”
   “I thought I'd be feeling a lot better than I do. I was a little premature in my
calculations. No kidding. I'm sorry. If you'll just get up a second, I'll get my wallet.
I mean it.”
   She was sore as hell, but she got up off my goddam lap so that I could go over
and get my wallet off the chiffonier. I took out a five-dollar bill and handed it to
her. “Thanks a lot,” I told her. “Thanks a million.”
   “This is a five. It costs ten.”
   She was getting funny, you could tell. I was afraid something like that would
happen—I really was.
   “Maurice said five,” I told her. “He said fifteen till noon and only five for a
throw.”
   “Ten for a throw.”
   “He said five. I'm sorry—I really am—but that's all I'm gonna shell out.”
   She sort of shrugged her shoulders, the way she did before, and then she said,
very cold, “Do you mind getting me my frock? Or would it be too much trouble?”
She was a pretty spooky kid. Even with that little bitty voice she had, she could
sort of scare you a little bit. If she'd been a big old prostitute, with a lot of makeup
on her face and all, she wouldn't have been half as spooky.
   I went and got her dress for her. She put it on and all, and then she picked up
her polo coat off the bed. “So long, crumb-bum,” she said.
   “So long,” I said. I didn't thank her or anything. I'm glad I didn't.


14
After old Sunny was gone, I sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of
cigarettes. It was getting daylight outside. Boy, I felt miserable. I felt so depressed,



                                          57
you can't imagine. What I did, I started talking, sort of out loud, to Allie. I do
that sometimes when I get very depressed. I keep telling him to go home and get
his bike and meet me in front of Bobby Fallon's house. Bobby Fallon used to live
quite near us in Maine—this is, years ago. Anyway, what happened was, one day
Bobby and I were going over to Lake Sedebego on our bikes. We were going to take
our lunches and all, and our BB guns—we were kids and all, and we thought we
could shoot something with our BB guns. Anyway, Allie heard us talking about it,
and he wanted to go, and I wouldn't let him. I told him he was a child. So once in
a while, now, when I get very depressed, I keep saying to him, “Okay. Go home and
get your bike and meet me in front of Bobby's house. Hurry up.” It wasn't that I
didn't use to take him with me when I went somewhere. I did. But that one day, I
didn't. He didn't get sore about it—he never got sore about anything— but I keep
thinking about it anyway, when I get very depressed.
   Finally, though, I got undressed and got in bed. I felt like praying or something,
when I was in bed, but I couldn't do it. I can't always pray when I feel like it. In the
first place, I'm sort of an atheist. I like Jesus and all, but I don't care too much for
most of the other stuff in the Bible. Take the Disciples, for instance. They annoy
the hell out of me, if you want to know the truth. They were all right after Jesus
was dead and all, but while He was alive, they were about as much use to Him as
a hole in the head. All they did was keep letting Him down. I like almost anybody
in the Bible better than the Disciples. If you want to know the truth, the guy I like
best in the Bible, next to Jesus, was that lunatic and all, that lived in the tombs
and kept cutting himself with stones. I like him ten times as much as the Disciples,
that poor bastard. I used to get in quite a few arguments about it, when I was at
Whooton School, with this boy that lived down the corridor, Arthur Childs. Old
Childs was a Quaker and all, and he read the Bible all the time. He was a very nice
kid, and I liked him, but I could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff in
the Bible, especially the Disciples. He kept telling me if I didn't like the Disciples,
then I didn't like Jesus and all. He said that because Jesus picked the Disciples, you
were supposed to like them. I said I knew He picked them, but that He picked them
at random. I said He didn't have time to go around analyzing everybody. I said I
wasn't blaming Jesus or anything. It wasn't His fault that He didn't have any time.
I remember I asked old Childs if he thought Judas, the one that betrayed Jesus and
all, went to Hell after he committed suicide. Childs said certainly. That's exactly
where I disagreed with him. I said I'd bet a thousand bucks that Jesus never sent
old Judas to Hell. I still would, too, if I had a thousand bucks. I think any one of
the Disciples would've sent him to Hell and all—and fast, too—but I'll bet anything
Jesus didn't do it. Old Childs said the trouble with me was that I didn't go to
church or anything. He was right about that, in a way. I don't. In the first place,
my parents are different religions, and all the children in our family are atheists. If
you want to know the truth, I can't even stand ministers. The ones they've had at
every school I've gone to, they all have these Holy Joe voices when they start giving
their sermons. God, I hate that. I don't see why the hell they can't talk in their
natural voice. They sound so phony when they talk.



                                          58
 Anyway, when I was in bed, I couldn't pray worth a damn. Every time I got
started, I kept picturing old Sunny calling me a crumb-bum. Finally, I sat up in
bed and smoked another cigarette. It tasted lousy. I must've smoked around two
packs since I left Pencey.
   All of a sudden, while I was laying there smoking, somebody knocked on the door.
I kept hoping it wasn't my door they were knocking on, but I knew damn well it
was. I don't know how I knew, but I knew. I knew who it was, too. I'm psychic.
   “Who's there?” I said. I was pretty scared. I'm very yellow about those things.
   They just knocked again, though. Louder.
   Finally I got out of bed, with just my pajamas on, and opened the door. I didn't
even have to turn the light on in the room, because it was already daylight. Old
Sunny and Maurice, the pimpy elevator guy, were standing there.
   “What's the matter? Wuddaya want?” I said. Boy, my voice was shaking like
hell.
   “Nothin' much,” old Maurice said. “Just five bucks.” He did all the talking for
the two of them. Old Sunny just stood there next to him, with her mouth open and
all.
   “I paid her already. I gave her five bucks. Ask her,” I said. Boy, was my voice
shaking.
   “It's ten bucks, chief. I tole ya that. Ten bucks for a throw, fifteen bucks till
noon. I tole ya that.”
   “You did not tell me that. You said five bucks a throw. You said fifteen bucks
till noon, all right, but I distinctly heard you—”
   “Open up, chief.”
   “What for? ” I said. God, my old heart was damn near beating me out of the
room. I wished I was dressed at least. It's terrible to be just in your pajamas when
something like that happens.
   “Let's go, chief,” old Maurice said. Then he gave me a big shove with his crumby
hand. I damn near fell over on my can—he was a huge sonuvabitch. The next thing
I knew, he and old Sunny were both in the room. They acted like they owned the
damn place. Old Sunny sat down on the window sill. Old Maurice sat down in the
big chair and loosened his collar and all—he was wearing this elevator operator's
uniform. Boy, was I nervous.
   “All right, chief, let's have it. I gotta get back to work.”
   “I told you about ten times, I don't owe you a cent. I already gave her the five—”
   “Cut the crap, now. Let's have it.”
   “Why should I give her another five bucks?” I said. My voice was cracking all
over the place. “You're trying to chisel me.”
   Old Maurice unbuttoned his whole uniform coat. All he had on underneath was
a phony shirt collar, but no shirt or anything. He had a big fat hairy stomach.
“Nobody's tryna chisel nobody,” he said. “Let's have it, chief.”
   “No.”
   When I said that, he got up from his chair and started walking towards me and
all. He looked like he was very, very tired or very, very bored. God, was I scared.



I sort of had my arms folded, I remember. It wouldn't have been so bad, I don't
think, if I hadn't had just my goddam pajamas on.
   “Let's have it, chief.” He came right up to where I was standing. That's all he
could say. “Let's have it, chief.” He was a real moron.
   “No.”
   “Chief, you're gonna force me inna roughin' ya up a little bit. I don't wanna do
it, but that's the way it looks,” he said. “You owe us five bucks.”
   “I don't owe you five bucks,” I said. “If you rough me up, I'll yell like hell. I'll
wake up everybody in the hotel. The police and all.” My voice was shaking like a
bastard.
   “Go ahead. Yell your goddam head off. Fine,” old Maurice said. “Want your
parents to know you spent the night with a whore? High-class kid like you?” He
was pretty sharp, in his crumby way. He really was.
   “Leave me alone. If you'd said ten, it'd be different. But you distinctly—”
   “Are ya gonna let us have it?” He had me right up against the damn door. He
was almost standing on top of me, his crumby old hairy stomach and all.
   “Leave me alone. Get the hell out of my room,” I said. I still had my arms folded
and all. God, what a jerk I was.
   Then Sunny said something for the first time. “Hey, Maurice. Want me to get
his wallet?” she said. “It's right on the wutchamacallit.”
   “Yeah, get it.”
   “Leave my wallet alone!”
   “I awreddy got it,” Sunny said. She waved five bucks at me. “See? All I'm takin'
is the five you owe me. I'm no crook.”
   All of a sudden I started to cry. I'd give anything if I hadn't, but I did. “No,
you're no crooks,” I said. “You're just stealing five—”
   “Shut up,” old Maurice said, and gave me a shove.
   “Leave him alone, hey,” Sunny said. “C'mon, hey. We got the dough he owes us.
Let's go. C'mon, hey.”
   “I'm comin',” old Maurice said. But he didn't.
   “I mean it, Maurice, hey. Leave him alone.”
   “Who's hurtin' anybody?” he said, innocent as hell. Then what he did, he
snapped his finger very hard on my pajamas. I won't tell you where he snapped it,
but it hurt like hell. I told him he was a goddam dirty moron. “What's that?” he
said. He put his hand behind his ear, like a deaf guy. “What's that? What am I?”
   I was still sort of crying. I was so damn mad and nervous and all. “You're a dirty
moron,” I said. “You're a stupid chiseling moron, and in about two years you'll be
one of those scraggy guys that come up to you on the street and ask for a dime for
coffee. You'll have snot all over your dirty filthy overcoat, and you'll be—”
   Then he smacked me. I didn't even try to get out of the way or duck or anything.
All I felt was this terrific punch in my stomach.
   I wasn't knocked out or anything, though, because I remember looking up from
the floor and seeing them both go out the door and shut it. Then I stayed on the
floor a fairly long time, sort of the way I did with Stradlater. Only, this time I



                                          60
thought I was dying. I really did. I thought I was drowning or something. The
trouble was, I could hardly breathe. When I did finally get up, I had to walk to the
bathroom all doubled up and holding onto my stomach and all.
   But I'm crazy. I swear to God I am. About halfway to the bathroom, I sort of
started pretending I had a bullet in my guts. Old Maurice had plugged me. Now
I was on the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something
to steady my nerves and help me really go into action. I pictured myself coming
out of the goddam bathroom, dressed and all, with my automatic in my pocket,
and staggering around a little bit. Then I'd walk downstairs, instead of using the
elevator. I'd hold onto the banister and all, with this blood trickling out of the side
of my mouth a little at a time. What I'd do, I'd walk down a few floors—holding
onto my guts, blood leaking all over the place— and then I'd ring the elevator bell.
As soon as old Maurice opened the doors, he'd see me with the automatic in my
hand and he'd start screaming at me, in this very high-pitched, yellow-belly voice,
to leave him alone. But I'd plug him anyway. Six shots right through his fat hairy
belly. Then I'd throw my automatic down the elevator shaft—after I'd wiped off
all the finger prints and all. Then I'd crawl back to my room and call up Jane and
have her come over and bandage up my guts. I pictured her holding a cigarette for
me to smoke while I was bleeding and all.
   The goddam movies. They can ruin you. I'm not kidding.
   I stayed in the bathroom for about an hour, taking a bath and all. Then I got back
in bed. It took me quite a while to get to sleep—I wasn't even tired—but finally I
did. What I really felt like, though, was committing suicide. I felt like jumping out
the window. I probably would've done it, too, if I'd been sure somebody'd cover me
up as soon as I landed. I didn't want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me
when I was all gory.


15
I didn't sleep too long, because I think it was only around ten o'clock when I woke
up. I felt pretty hungry as soon as I had a cigarette. The last time I'd eaten
was those two hamburgers I had with Brossard and Ackley when we went in to
Agerstown to the movies. That was a long time ago. It seemed like fifty years ago.
The phone was right next to me, and I started to call down and have them send up
some breakfast, but I was sort of afraid they might send it up with old Maurice. If
you think I was dying to see him again, you're crazy. So I just laid around in bed
for a while and smoked another cigarette. I thought of giving old Jane a buzz, to
see if she was home yet and all, but I wasn't in the mood.
   What I did do, I gave old Sally Hayes a buzz. She went to Mary A. Woodruff,
and I knew she was home because I'd had this letter from her a couple of weeks ago.
I wasn't too crazy about her, but I'd known her for years. I used to think she was
quite intelligent, in my stupidity. The reason I did was because she knew quite a
lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff. If somebody knows
quite a lot about those things, it takes you quite a while to find out whether they're



really stupid or not. It took me years to find it out, in old Sally's case. I think I'd
have found it out a lot sooner if we hadn't necked so damn much. My big trouble is,
I always sort of think whoever I'm necking is a pretty intelligent person. It hasn't
got a goddam thing to do with it, but I keep thinking it anyway.
   Anyway, I gave her a buzz. First the maid answered. Then her father. Then she
got on. “Sally?” I said.
   “Yes—who is this?” she said. She was quite a little phony. I'd already told her
father who it was.
   “Holden Caulfield. How are ya?”
   “Holden! I'm fine! How are you?”
   “Swell. Listen. How are ya, anyway? I mean how's school?”
   “Fine,” she said. “I mean—you know.”
   “Swell. Well, listen. I was wondering if you were busy today. It's Sunday, but
there's always one or two matinees going on Sunday. Benefits and that stuff. Would
you care to go?”
   “I'd love to. Grand.”
   Grand. If there's one word I hate, it's grand. It's so phony. For a second, I was
tempted to tell her to forget about the matinee. But we chewed the fat for a while.
That is, she chewed it. You couldn't get a word in edgewise. First she told me about
some Harvard guy— it probably was a freshman, but she didn't say, naturally—that
was rushing hell out of her. Calling her up night and day. Night and day—that
killed me. Then she told me about some other guy, some West Point cadet, that was
cutting his throat over her too. Big deal. I told her to meet me under the clock at
the Biltmore at two o'clock, and not to be late, because the show probably started
at two-thirty. She was always late. Then I hung up. She gave me a pain in the ass,
but she was very good-looking.
   After I made the date with old Sally, I got out of bed and got dressed and packed
my bag. I took a look out the window before I left the room, though, to see how all
the perverts were doing, but they all had their shades down. They were the heighth
of modesty in the morning. Then I went down in the elevator and checked out. I
didn't see old Maurice around anywhere. I didn't break my neck looking for him,
naturally, the bastard.
   I got a cab outside the hotel, but I didn't have the faintest damn idea where
I was going. I had no place to go. It was only Sunday, and I couldn't go home
till Wednesday—or Tuesday the soonest. And I certainly didn't feel like going to
another hotel and getting my brains beat out. So what I did, I told the driver to take
me to Grand Central Station. It was right near the Biltmore, where I was meeting
Sally later, and I figured what I'd do, I'd check my bags in one of those strong
boxes that they give you a key to, then get some breakfast. I was sort of hungry.
While I was in the cab, I took out my wallet and sort of counted my money. I don't
remember exactly what I had left, but it was no fortune or anything. I'd spent a
king's ransom in about two lousy weeks. I really had. I'm a goddam spendthrift
at heart. What I don't spend, I lose. Half the time I sort of even forget to pick
up my change, at restaurants and night clubs and all. It drives my parents crazy.



                                          62
You can't blame them. My father's quite wealthy, though. I don't know how much
he makes—he's never discussed that stuff with me—but I imagine quite a lot. He's
a corporation lawyer. Those boys really haul it in. Another reason I know he's
quite well off, he's always investing money in shows on Broadway. They always flop,
though, and it drives my mother crazy when he does it. She hasn't felt too healthy
since my brother Allie died. She's very nervous. That's another reason why I hated
like hell for her to know I got the ax again.
   After I put my bags in one of those strong boxes at the station, I went into this
little sandwich bar and bad breakfast. I had quite a large breakfast, for me—orange
juice, bacon and eggs, toast and coffee. Usually I just drink some orange juice. I'm
a very light eater. I really am. That's why I'm so damn skinny. I was supposed to
be on this diet where you eat a lot of starches and crap, to gain weight and all, but
I didn't ever do it. When I'm out somewhere, I generally just eat a Swiss cheese
sandwich and a malted milk. It isn't much, but you get quite a lot of vitamins in
the malted milk. H. V. Caulfield. Holden Vitamin Caulfield.
   While I was eating my eggs, these two nuns with suitcases and all—I guessed
they were moving to another convent or something and were waiting for a train—
came in and sat down next to me at the counter. They didn't seem to know what
the hell to do with their suitcases, so I gave them a hand. They were these very
inexpensive-looking suitcases—the ones that aren't genuine leather or anything. It
isn't important, I know, but I hate it when somebody has cheap suitcases. It sounds
terrible to say it, but I can even get to hate somebody, just look ing at them, if they
have cheap suitcases with them. Something happened once. For a while when I was
at Elkton Hills, I roomed with this boy, Dick Slagle, that had these very inexpensive
suitcases. He used to keep them under the bed, instead of on the rack, so that
nobody'd see them standing next to mine. It depressed holy hell out of me, and I
kept wanting to throw mine out or something, or even trade with him. Mine came
from Mark Cross, and they were genuine cowhide and all that crap, and I guess they
cost quite a pretty penny. But it was a funny thing. Here's what happened. What
I did, I finally put my suitcases under my bed, instead of on the rack, so that old
Slagle wouldn't get a goddam inferiority complex about it. But here's what he did.
The day after I put mine under my bed, he took them out and put them back on the
rack. The reason he did it, it took me a while to find out, was because he wanted
people to think my bags were his. He really did. He was a very funny guy, that way.
He was always saying snotty things about them, my suitcases, for instance. He kept
saying they were too new and bourgeois. That was his favorite goddam word. He
read it somewhere or heard it somewhere. Everything I had was bourgeois as hell.
Even my fountain pen was bourgeois. He borrowed it off me all the time, but it
was bourgeois anyway. We only roomed together about two months. Then we both
asked to be moved. And the funny thing was, I sort of missed him after we moved,
because he had a helluva good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes.
I wouldn't be surprised if he missed me, too. At first he only used to be kidding
when he called my stuff bourgeois, and I didn't give a damn—it was sort of funny,
in fact. Then, after a while, you could tell he wasn't kidding any more. The thing



is, it's really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better
than theirs—if yours are really good ones and theirs aren't. You think if they're
intelligent and all, the other person, and have a good sense of humor, that they
don't give a damn whose suitcases are better, but they do. They really do. It's
one of the reasons why I roomed with a stupid bastard like Stradlater. At least his
suitcases were as good as mine.
   Anyway, these two nuns were sitting next to me, and we sort of struck up a
conversation. The one right next to me had one of those straw baskets that you
see nuns and Salvation Army babes collecting dough with around Christmas time.
You see them standing on corners, especially on Fifth Avenue, in front of the big
department stores and all. Anyway, the one next to me dropped hers on the floor
and I reached down and picked it up for her. I asked her if she was out collecting
money for charity and all. She said no. She said she couldn't get it in her suitcase
when she was packing it and she was just carrying it. She had a pretty nice smile
when she looked at you. She had a big nose, and she had on those glasses with sort
of iron rims that aren't too attractive, but she had a helluva kind face. “I thought
if you were taking up a collection,” I told her, “I could make a small contribution.
You could keep the money for when you do take up a collection.”
   “Oh, how very kind of you,” she said, and the other one, her friend, looked over
at me. The other one was reading a little black book while she drank her coffee. It
looked like a Bible, but it was too skinny. It was a Bible-type book, though. All the
two of them were eating for breakfast was toast and coffee. That depressed me. I
hate it if I'm eating bacon and eggs or something and somebody else is only eating
toast and coffee.
   They let me give them ten bucks as a contribution. They kept asking me if I was
sure I could afford it and all. I told them I had quite a bit of money with me, but
they didn't seem to believe me. They took it, though, finally. The both of them
kept thanking me so much it was embarrassing. I swung the conversation around
to general topics and asked them where they were going. They said they were
schoolteachers and that they'd just come from Chicago and that they were going to
start teaching at some convent on 168th Street or 186th Street or one of those streets
way the hell uptown. The one next to me, with the iron glasses, said she taught
English and her friend taught history and American government. Then I started
wondering like a bastard what the one sitting next to me, that taught English,
thought about, being a nun and all, when she read certain books for English. Books
not necessarily with a lot of sexy stuff in them, but books with lovers and all in them.
Take old Eustacia Vye, in The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy. She wasn't
too sexy or anything, but even so you can't help wondering what a nun maybe thinks
about when she reads about old Eustacia. I didn't say anything, though, naturally.
All I said was English was my best subject.
   “Oh, really? Oh, I'm so glad!” the one with the glasses, that taught English,
said. “What have you read this year? I'd be very interested to know.” She was
really nice.




                                          64

   “Well, most of the time we were on the Anglo-Saxons. Beowulf, and old Grendel,
and Lord Randal My Son, and all those things. But we had to read outside books
for extra credit once in a while. I read The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy,
and Romeo and Juliet and Julius—”
   “Oh, Romeo and Juliet! Lovely! Didn't you just love it?” She certainly didn't
sound much like a nun.
   “Yes. I did. I liked it a lot. There were a few things I didn't like about it, but it
was quite moving, on the whole.”
   “What didn't you like about it? Can you remember?” To tell you the truth,
it was sort of embarrassing, in a way, to be talking about Romeo and Juliet with
her. I mean that play gets pretty sexy in some parts, and she was a nun and all,
but she asked me, so I discussed it with her for a while. “Well, I'm not too crazy
about Romeo and Juliet,” I said. “I mean I like them, but—I don't know. They get
pretty annoying sometimes. I mean I felt much sorrier when old Mercutio got killed
than when Romeo and Juliet did. The think is, I never liked Romeo too much after
Mercutio gets stabbed by that other man—Juliet's cousin—what's his name?”
   “Tybalt.”
   “That's right. Tybalt,” I said—I always forget that guy's name. “It was Romeo's
fault. I mean I liked him the best in the play, old Mercutio. I don't know. All
those Montagues and Capulets, they're all right—especially Juliet—but Mercutio,
he was—it's hard to explain. He was very smart and entertaining and all. The thing
is, it drives me crazy if somebody gets killed— especially somebody very smart and
entertaining and all—and it's somebody else's fault. Romeo and Juliet, at least it
was their own fault.”
   “What school do you go to?” she asked me. She probably wanted to get off the
subject of Romeo and Juliet.
   I told her Pencey, and she'd heard of it. She said it was a very good school. I let
it pass, though. Then the other one, the one that taught history and government,
said they'd better be running along. I took their check off them, but they wouldn't
let me pay it. The one with the glasses made me give it back to her.
   “You've been more than generous,” she said. “You're a very sweet boy.” She
certainly was nice. She reminded me a little bit of old Ernest Morrow's mother, the
one I met on the train. When she smiled, mostly. “We've enjoyed talking to you so
much,” she said.
   I said I'd enjoyed talking to them a lot, too. I meant it, too. I'd have enjoyed
it even more though, I think, if I hadn't been sort of afraid, the whole time I was
talking to them, that they'd all of a sudden try to find out if I was a Catholic.
Catholics are always trying to find out if you're a Catholic. It happens to me a lot,
I know, partly because my last name is Irish, and most people of Irish descent are
Catholics. As a matter of fact, my father was a Catholic once. He quit, though,
when he married my mother. But Catholics are always trying to find out if you're a
Catholic even if they don't know your last name. I knew this one Catholic boy, Louis
Shaney, when I was at the Whooton School. He was the first boy I ever met there.
He and I were sitting in the first two chairs outside the goddam infirmary, the day



                                          65
school opened, waiting for our physicals, and we sort of struck up this conversation
about tennis. He was quite interested in tennis, and so was I. He told me he went
to the Nationals at Forest Hills every summer, and I told him I did too, and then
we talked about certain hot-shot tennis players for quite a while. He knew quite
a lot about tennis, for a kid his age. He really did. Then, after a while, right in
the middle of the goddam conversation, he asked me, “Did you happen to notice
where the Catholic church is in town, by any chance?” The thing was, you could
tell by the way he asked me that he was trying to find out if I was a Catholic. He
really was. Not that he was prejudiced or anything, but he just wanted to know. He
was enjoying the conversation about tennis and all, but you could tell he would've
enjoyed it more if I was a Catholic and all. That kind of stuff drives me crazy.
I'm not saying it ruined our conversation or anything—it didn't—but it sure as hell
didn't do it any good. That's why I was glad those two nuns didn't ask me if I was
a Catholic. It wouldn't have spoiled the conversation if they had, but it would've
been different, probably. I'm not saying I blame Catholics. I don't. I'd be the same
way, probably, if I was a Catholic. It's just like those suitcases I was telling you
about, in a way. All I'm saying is that it's no good for a nice conversation. That's
all I'm saying.
   When they got up to go, the two nuns, I did something very stupid and embar-
rassing. I was smoking a cigarette, and when I stood up to say good-by to them,
by mistake I blew some smoke in their face. I didn't mean to, but I did it. I apolo-
gized like a madman, and they were very polite and nice about it, but it was very
embarrassing anyway.
   After they left, I started getting sorry that I'd only given them ten bucks for
their collection. But the thing was, I'd made that date to go to a matinee with old
Sally Hayes, and I needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff. I was sorry
anyway, though. Goddam money. It always ends up making you blue as hell.


16
After I had my breakfast, it was only around noon, and I wasn't meeting old Sally
till two o'clock, so I started taking this long walk. I couldn't stop thinking about
those two nuns. I kept thinking about that beatup old straw basket they went
around collecting money with when they weren't teaching school. I kept trying to
picture my mother or somebody, or my aunt, or Sally Hayes's crazy mother, standing
outside some department store and collecting dough for poor people in a beat-up
old straw basket. It was hard to picture. Not so much my mother, but those other
two. My aunt's pretty charitable—she does a lot of Red Cross work and all—but
she's very well-dressed and all, and when she does anything charitable she's always
very well-dressed and has lipstick on and all that crap. I couldn't picture her doing
anything for charity if she had to wear black clothes and no lipstick while she was
doing it. And old Sally Hayes's mother. Jesus Christ. The only way she could go
around with a basket collecting dough would be if everybody kissed her ass for her
when they made a contribution. If they just dropped their dough in her basket,



                                         66
then walked away without saying anything to her, ignoring her and all, she'd quit
in about an hour. She'd get bored. She'd hand in her basket and then go someplace
swanky for lunch. That's what I liked about those nuns. You could tell, for one
thing, that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch. It made me so damn sad
when I thought about it, their never going anywhere swanky for lunch or anything.
I knew it wasn't too important, but it made me sad anyway.
   I started walking over toward Broadway, just for the hell of it, because I hadn't
been over there in years. Besides, I wanted to find a record store that was open on
Sunday. There was this record I wanted to get for Phoebe, called “Little Shirley
Beans.” It was a very hard record to get. It was about a little kid that wouldn't
go out of the house because two of her front teeth were out and she was ashamed
to. I heard it at Pencey. A boy that lived on the next floor had it, and I tried to
buy it off him because I knew it would knock old Phoebe out, but he wouldn't sell
it. It was a very old, terrific record that this colored girl singer, Estelle Fletcher,
made about twenty years ago. She sings it very Dixieland and whorehouse, and it
doesn't sound at all mushy. If a white girl was singing it, she'd make it sound cute
as hell, but old Estelle Fletcher knew what the hell she was doing, and it was one
of the best records I ever heard. I figured I'd buy it in some store that was open
on Sunday and then I'd take it up to the park with me. It was Sunday and Phoebe
goes rollerskating in the park on Sundays quite frequently. I knew where she hung
out mostly.
   It wasn't as cold as it was the day before, but the sun still wasn't out, and it
wasn't too nice for walking. But there was one nice thing. This family that you
could tell just came out of some church were walking right in front of me—a father,
a mother, and a little kid about six years old. They looked sort of poor. The father
had on one of those pearl-gray hats that poor guys wear a lot when they want to look
sharp. He and his wife were just walking along, talking, not paying any attention
to their kid. The kid was swell. He was walking in the street, instead of on the
sidewalk, but right next to the curb. He was making out like he was walking a very
straight line, the way kids do, and the whole time he kept singing and humming.
I got up closer so I could hear what he was singing. He was singing that song, “If
a body catch a body coming through the rye.” He had a pretty little voice, too.
He was just singing for the hell of it, you could tell. The cars zoomed by, brakes
screeched all over the place, his parents paid no attention to him, and he kept on
walking next to the curb and singing “If a body catch a body coming through the
rye.” It made me feel better. It made me feel not so depressed any more.
   Broadway was mobbed and messy. It was Sunday, and only about twelve o'clock,
but it was mobbed anyway. Everybody was on their way to the movies—the
Paramount or the Astor or the Strand or the Capitol or one of those crazy places.
Everybody was all dressed up, because it was Sunday, and that made it worse.
But the worst part was that you could tell they all wanted to go to the movies. I
couldn't stand looking at them. I can understand somebody going to the movies
because there's nothing else to do, but when somebody really wants to go, and even
walks fast so as to get there quicker, then it depresses hell out of me. Especially if I



                                          67
see millions of people standing in one of those long, terrible lines, all the way down
the block, waiting with this terrific patience for seats and all. Boy, I couldn't get off
that goddam Broadway fast enough. I was lucky. The first record store I went into
had a copy of “Little Shirley Beans.” They charged me five bucks for it, because it
was so hard to get, but I didn't care. Boy, it made me so happy all of a sudden. I
could hardly wait to get to the park to see if old Phoebe was around so that I could
give it to her.
   When I came out of the record store, I passed this drugstore, and I went in. I
figured maybe I'd give old Jane a buzz and see if she was home for vacation yet.
So I went in a phone booth and called her up. The only trouble was, her mother
answered the phone, so I had to hang up. I didn't feel like getting involved in a
long conversation and all with her. I'm not crazy about talking to girls' mothers on
the phone anyway. I should've at least asked her if Jane was home yet, though. It
wouldn't have killed me. But I didn't feel like it. You really have to be in the mood
for that stuff.
   I still had to get those damn theater tickets, so I bought a paper and looked up to
see what shows were playing. On account of it was Sunday, there were only about
three shows playing. So what I did was, I went over and bought two orchestra seats
for I Know My Love. It was a benefit performance or something. I didn't much
want to see it, but I knew old Sally, the queen of the phonies, would start drooling
all over the place when I told her I had tickets for that, because the Lunts were in
it and all. She liked shows that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and
all, with the Lunts and all. I don't. I don't like any shows very much, if you want
to know the truth. They're not as bad as movies, but they're certainly nothing to
rave about. In the first place, I hate actors. They never act like people. They just
think they do. Some of the good ones do, in a very slight way, but not in a way
that's fun to watch. And if any actor's really good, you can always tell he knows
he's good, and that spoils it. You take Sir Laurence Olivier, for example. I saw him
in Hamlet. D.B. took Phoebe and I to see it last year. He treated us to lunch first,
and then he took us. He'd already seen it, and the way he talked about it at lunch,
I was anxious as hell to see it, too. But I didn't enjoy it much. I just don't see
what's so marvelous about Sir Laurence Olivier, that's all. He has a terrific voice,
and he's a helluva handsome guy, and he's very nice to watch when he's walking or
dueling or something, but he wasn't at all the way D.B. said Hamlet was. He was
too much like a goddam general, instead of a sad, screwed-up type guy. The best
part in the whole picture was when old Ophelia's brother—the one that gets in the
duel with Hamlet at the very end—was going away and his father was giving him
a lot of advice. While the father kept giving him a lot of advice, old Ophelia was
sort of horsing around with her brother, taking his dagger out of the holster, and
teasing him and all while he was trying to look interested in the bull his father was
shooting. That was nice. I got a big bang out of that. But you don't see that kind
of stuff much. The only thing old Phoebe liked was when Hamlet patted this dog on
the head. She thought that was funny and nice, and it was. What I'll have to do is,
I'll have to read that play. The trouble with me is, I always have to read that stuff



                                           68
by myself. If an actor acts it out, I hardly listen. I keep worrying about whether
he's going to do something phony every minute.
   After I got the tickets to the Lunts' show, I took a cab up to the park. I should've
taken a subway or something, because I was getting slightly low on dough, but I
wanted to get off that damn Broadway as fast as I could.
   It was lousy in the park. It wasn't too cold, but the sun still wasn't out, and
there didn't look like there was anything in the park except dog crap and globs of
spit and cigar butts from old men, and the benches all looked like they'd be wet if
you sat down on them. It made you depressed, and every once in a while, for no
reason, you got goose flesh while you walked. It didn't seem at all like Christmas
was coming soon. It didn't seem like anything was coming. But I kept walking over
to the Mall anyway, because that's where Phoebe usually goes when she's in the
park. She likes to skate near the bandstand. It's funny. That's the same place I
used to like to skate when I was a kid.
   When I got there, though, I didn't see her around anywhere. There were a few
kids around, skating and all, and two boys were playing Flys Up with a soft ball, but
no Phoebe. I saw one kid about her age, though, sitting on a bench all by herself,
tightening her skate. I thought maybe she might know Phoebe and could tell me
where she was or something, so I went over and sat down next to her and asked her,
“Do you know Phoebe Caulfield, by any chance?”
   “Who?” she said. All she had on was jeans and about twenty sweaters. You
could tell her mother made them for her, because they were lumpy as hell.
   “Phoebe Caulfield. She lives on Seventy-first Street. She's in the fourth grade,
over at—”
   “You know Phoebe?”
   “Yeah, I'm her brother. You know where she is?”
   “She's in Miss Callon's class, isn't she?” the kid said.
   “I don't know. Yes, I think she is.”
   “She's prob'ly in the museum, then. We went last Saturday,” the kid said.
   “Which museum?” I asked her.
   She shrugged her shoulders, sort of. “I don't know,” she said. “The museum.”
   “I know, but the one where the pictures are, or the one where the Indians are?”
   “The one where the Indians.”
   “Thanks a lot,” I said. I got up and started to go, but then I suddenly remembered
it was Sunday. “This is Sunday,” I told the kid.
   She looked up at me. “Oh. Then she isn't.”
   She was having a helluva time tightening her skate. She didn't have any gloves
on or anything and her hands were all red and cold. I gave her a hand with it. Boy,
I hadn't had a skate key in my hand for years. It didn't feel funny, though. You
could put a skate key in my hand fifty years from now, in pitch dark, and I'd still
know what it is. She thanked me and all when I had it tightened for her. She was
a very nice, polite little kid. God, I love it when a kid's nice and polite when you
tighten their skate for them or something. Most kids are. They really are. I asked
her if she'd care to have a hot chocolate or something with me, but she said no,



                                          69

thank you. She said she had to meet her friend. Kids always have to meet their
friend. That kills me.
   Even though it was Sunday and Phoebe wouldn't be there with her class or
anything, and even though it was so damp and lousy out, I walked all the way
through the park over to the Museum of Natural History. I knew that was the
museum the kid with the skate key meant. I knew that whole museum routine like a
book. Phoebe went to the same school I went to when I was a kid, and we used to go
there all the time. We had this teacher, Miss Aigletinger, that took us there damn
near every Saturday. Sometimes we looked at the animals and sometimes we looked
at the stuff the Indians had made in ancient times. Pottery and straw baskets and
all stuff like that. I get very happy when I think about it. Even now. I remember
after we looked at all the Indian stuff, usually we went to see some movie in this big
auditorium. Columbus. They were always showing Columbus discovering America,
having one helluva time getting old Ferdinand and Isabella to lend him the dough
to buy ships with, and then the sailors mutinying on him and all. Nobody gave
too much of a damn about old Columbus, but you always had a lot of candy and
gum and stuff with you, and the inside of that auditorium had such a nice smell. It
always smelled like it was raining outside, even if it wasn't, and you were in the only
nice, dry, cosy place in the world. I loved that damn museum. I remember you had
to go through the Indian Room to get to the auditorium. It was a long, long room,
and you were only supposed to whisper. The teacher would go first, then the class.
You'd be two rows of kids, and you'd have a partner. Most of the time my partner
was this girl named Gertrude Levine. She always wanted to hold your hand, and her
hand was always sticky or sweaty or something. The floor was all stone, and if you
had some marbles in your hand and you dropped them, they bounced like madmen
all over the floor and made a helluva racket, and the teacher would hold up the class
and go back and see what the hell was going on. She never got sore, though, Miss
Aigletinger. Then you'd pass by this long, long Indian war canoe, about as long
as three goddam Cadillacs in a row, with about twenty Indians in it, some of them
paddling, some of them just standing around looking tough, and they all had war
paint all over their faces. There was one very spooky guy in the back of the canoe,
with a mask on. He was the witch doctor. He gave me the creeps, but I liked him
anyway. Another thing, if you touched one of the paddles or anything while you
were passing, one of the guards would say to you, “Don't touch anything, children,”
but he always said it in a nice voice, not like a goddam cop or anything. Then you'd
pass by this big glass case, with Indians inside it rubbing sticks together to make a
fire, and a squaw weaving a blanket. The squaw that was weaving the blanket was
sort of bending over, and you could see her bosom and all. We all used to sneak a
good look at it, even the girls, because they were only little kids and they didn't have
any more bosom than we did. Then, just before you went inside the auditorium,
right near the doors, you passed this Eskimo. He was sitting over a hole in this icy
lake, and he was fishing through it. He had about two fish right next to the hole,
that he'd already caught. Boy, that museum was full of glass cases. There were even
more upstairs, with deer inside them drinking at water holes, and birds flying south



                                          70

                         for the winter. The birds nearest you were all stuffed and hung up on wires, and the
ones in back were just painted on the wall, but they all looked like they were really
flying south, and if you bent your head down and sort of looked at them upside
down, they looked in an even bigger hurry to fly south. The best thing, though,
in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. Nobody'd
move. You could go there a hundred thousand times, and that Eskimo would still
be just finished catching those two fish, the birds would still be on their way south,
the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole, with their pretty antlers
and their pretty, skinny legs, and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be
weaving that same blanket. Nobody'd be different. The only thing that would be
different would be you. Not that you'd be so much older or anything. It wouldn't
be that, exactly. You'd just be different, that's all. You'd have an overcoat on this
time. Or the kid that was your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever
and you'd have a new partner. Or you'd have a substitute taking the class, instead
of Miss Aigletinger. Or you'd heard your mother and father having a terrific fight
in the bathroom. Or you'd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with
gasoline rainbows in them. I mean you'd be dif ferent in some way—I can't explain
what I mean. And even if I could, I'm not sure I'd feel like it.
   I took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while I walked, and put it on. I
knew I wouldn't meet anybody that knew me, and it was pretty damp out. I kept
walking and walking, and I kept thinking about old Phoebe going to that museum
on Saturdays the way I used to. I thought how she'd see the same stuff I used to
see, and how she'd be different every time she saw it. It didn't exactly depress me
to think about it, but it didn't make me feel gay as hell, either. Certain things they
should stay the way they are. You ought to be able to stick them in one of those
big glass cases and just leave them alone. I know that's impossible, but it's too bad
anyway. Anyway, I kept thinking about all that while I walked.
   I passed by this playground and stopped and watched a couple of very tiny kids
on a seesaw. One of them was sort of fat, and I put my hand on the skinny kid's
end, to sort of even up the weight, but you could tell they didn't want me around,
so I let them alone.
   Then a funny thing happened. When I got to the museum, all of a sudden I
wouldn't have gone inside for a million bucks. It just didn't appeal to me—and
here I'd walked through the whole goddam park and looked forward to it and all. If
Phoebe'd been there, I probably would have, but she wasn't. So all I did, in front
of the museum, was get a cab and go down to the Biltmore. I didn't feel much like
going. I'd made that damn date with Sally, though.


17
I was way early when I got there, so I just sat down on one of those leather couches
right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls. A lot of schools were home
for vacation already, and there were about a million girls sitting and standing around
waiting for their dates to show up. Girls with their legs crossed, girls with their legs



                                          71

not crossed, girls with terrific legs, girls with lousy legs, girls that looked like swell
girls, girls that looked like they'd be bitches if you knew them. It was really nice
sightseeing, if you know what I mean. In a way, it was sort of depressing, too,
because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them. When they
got out of school and college, I mean. You figured most of them would probably
marry dopey guys. Guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon
in their goddam cars. Guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at
golf, or even just some stupid game like ping-pong. Guys that are very mean. Guys
that never read books. Guys that are very boring—But I have to be careful about
that. I mean about calling certain guys bores. I don't understand boring guys. I
really don't. When I was at Elkton Hills, I roomed for about two months with this
boy, Harris Mackim. He was very intelligent and all, but he was one of the biggest
bores I ever met. He had one of these very raspy voices, and he never stopped
talking, practically. He never stopped talking, and what was awful was, he never
said anything you wanted to hear in the first place. But he could do one thing.
The sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody I ever heard. He'd be making
his bed, or hanging up stuff in the closet—he was always hanging up stuff in the
closet—it drove me crazy—and he'd be whistling while he did it, if he wasn't talking
in this raspy voice. He could even whistle classical stuff, but most of the time he
just whistled jazz. He could take something very jazzy, like “Tin Roof Blues,” and
whistle it so nice and easy—right while he was hanging stuff up in the closet—that
it could kill you. Naturally, I never told him I thought he was a terrific whistler. I
mean you don't just go up to somebody and say, “You're a terrific whistler.” But I
roomed with him for about two whole months, even though he bored me till I was
half crazy, just because he was such a terrific whistler, the best I ever heard. So I
don't know about bores. Maybe you shouldn't feel too sorry if you see some swell
girl getting married to them. They don't hurt anybody, most of them, and maybe
they're secretly all terrific whistlers or something. Who the hell knows? Not me.
   Finally, old Sally started coming up the stairs, and I started down to meet her.
She looked terrific. She really did. She had on this black coat and sort of a black
beret. She hardly ever wore a hat, but that beret looked nice. The funny part is, I
felt like marrying her the minute I saw her. I'm crazy. I didn't even like her much,
and yet all of a sudden I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. I
swear to God I'm crazy. I admit it.
   “Holden!” she said. “It's marvelous to see you! It's been ages.” She had one of
these very loud, embarrassing voices when you met her somewhere. She got away
with it because she was so damn good-looking, but it always gave me a pain in the
ass.
   “Swell to see you,” I said. I meant it, too. “How are ya, anyway?”
   “Absolutely marvelous. Am I late?”
   I told her no, but she was around ten minutes late, as a matter of fact. I didn't
give a damn, though. All that crap they have in cartoons in the Saturday Evening
Post and all, showing guys on street corners looking sore as hell because their dates
are late—that's bunk. If a girl looks swell when she meets you, who gives a damn if



                                           72

she's late? Nobody. “We better hurry,” I said. “The show starts at two-forty.” We
started going down the stairs to where the taxis are.
   “What are we going to see?” she said.
   “I don't know. The Lunts. It's all I could get tickets for.”
   “The Lunts! Oh, marvelous!” I told you she'd go mad when she heard it was for
the Lunts.
   We horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater. At first
she didn't want to, because she had her lipstick on and all, but I was being seductive
as hell and she didn't have any alternative. Twice, when the goddam cab stopped
short in traffic, I damn near fell off the seat. Those damn drivers never even look
where they're going, I swear they don't. Then, just to show you how crazy I am,
when we were coming out of this big clinch, I told her I loved her and all. It was a
lie, of course, but the thing is, I meant it when I said it. I'm crazy. I swear to God
I am.
   “Oh, darling, I love you too,” she said. Then, right in the same damn breath, she
said, “Promise me you'll let your hair grow. Crew cuts are getting corny. And your
hair's so lovely.”
   Lovely my ass.
   The show wasn't as bad as some I've seen. It was on the crappy side, though. It
was about five hundred thousand years in the life of this one old couple. It starts
out when they're young and all, and the girl's parents don't want her to marry the
boy, but she marries him anyway. Then they keep getting older and older. The
husband goes to war, and the wife has this brother that's a drunkard. I couldn't get
very interested. I mean I didn't care too much when anybody in the family died or
anything. They were all just a bunch of actors. The husband and wife were a pretty
nice old couple—very witty and all—but I couldn't get too interested in them. For
one thing, they kept drinking tea or some goddam thing all through the play. Every
time you saw them, some butler was shoving some tea in front of them, or the wife
was pouring it for somebody. And everybody kept coming in and going out all
the time—you got dizzy watching people sit down and stand up. Alfred Lunt and
Lynn Fontanne were the old couple, and they were very good, but I didn't like them
much. They were different, though, I'll say that. They didn't act like people and
they didn't act like actors. It's hard to explain. They acted more like they knew
they were celebrities and all. I mean they were good, but they were too good. When
one of them got finished making a speech, the other one said something very fast
right after it. It was supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each
other and all. The trouble was, it was too much like people talking and interrupting
each other. They acted a little bit the way old Ernie, down in the Village, plays the
piano. If you do something too good, then, after a while, if you don't watch it, you
start showing off. And then you're not as good any more. But anyway, they were
the only ones in the show—the Lunts, I mean—that looked like they had any real
brains. I have to admit it.
   At the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerks for a cigarette.
What a deal that was. You never saw so many phonies in all your life, everybody



                                         73

smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and
know how sharp they were. Some dopey movie actor was standing near us, having
a cigarette. I don't know his name, but he always plays the part of a guy in a
war movie that gets yellow before it's time to go over the top. He was with some
gorgeous blonde, and the two of them were trying to be very blasé and all, like as if
he didn't even know people were looking at him. Modest as hell. I got a big bang
out of it. Old Sally didn't talk much, except to rave about the Lunts, because she
was busy rubbering and being charming. Then all of a sudden, she saw some jerk
she knew on the other side of the lobby. Some guy in one of those very dark gray
flannel suits and one of those checkered vests. Strictly Ivy League. Big deal. He was
standing next to the wall, smoking himself to death and looking bored as hell. Old
Sally kept saying, “I know that boy from somewhere.” She always knew somebody,
any place you took her, or thought she did. She kept saying that till I got bored
as hell, and I said to her, “Why don't you go on over and give him a big soul kiss,
if you know him? He'll enjoy it.” She got sore when I said that. Finally, though,
the jerk noticed her and came over and said hello. You should've seen the way they
said hello. You'd have thought they hadn't seen each other in twenty years. You'd
have thought they'd taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were
little kids. Old buddyroos. It was nauseating. The funny part was, they probably
met each other just once, at some phony party. Finally, when they were all done
slobbering around, old Sally introduced us. His name was George something—I
don't even remember—and he went to Andover. Big, big deal. You should've seen
him when old Sally asked him how he liked the play. He was the kind of a phony that
have to give themselves room when they answer somebody's question. He stepped
back, and stepped right on the lady's foot behind him. He probably broke every
toe in her body. He said the play itself was no masterpiece, but that the Lunts, of
course, were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake. Angels. That killed me. Then
he and old Sally started talking about a lot of people they both knew. It was the
phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life. They both kept thinking of places
as fast as they could, then they'd think of somebody that lived there and mention
their name. I was all set to puke when it was time to go sit down again. I really
was. And then, when the next act was over, they continued their goddam boring
conversation. They kept thinking of more places and more names of people that
lived there. The worst part was, the jerk had one of those very phony, Ivy League
voices, one of those very tired, snobby voices. He sounded just like a girl. He didn't
hesitate to horn in on my date, the bastard. I even thought for a minute that he was
going to get in the goddam cab with us when the show was over, because he walked
about two blocks with us, but he had to meet a bunch of phonies for cocktails, he
said. I could see them all sitting around in some bar, with their goddam checkered
vests, criticizing shows and books and women in those tired, snobby voices. They
kill me, those guys.
   I sort of hated old Sally by the time we got in the cab, after listening to that
phony Andover bastard for about ten hours. I was all set to take her home and
all—I really was—but she said, “I have a marvelous idea!” She was always having a



                                         74

marvelous idea. “Listen,” she said. “What time do you have to be home for dinner?
I mean are you in a terrible hurry or anything? Do you have to be home any special
time?”
   “Me? No. No special time,” I said. Truer word was never spoken, boy. “Why?”
   “Let's go ice-skating at Radio City!”
   That's the kind of ideas she always had.
   “Ice-skating at Radio City? You mean right now?”
   “Just for an hour or so. Don't you want to? If you don't want to—”
   “I didn't say I didn't want to,” I said. “Sure. If you want to.”
   “Do you mean it? Don't just say it if you don't mean it. I mean I don't give a
darn, one way or the other.”
   Not much she didn't.
   “You can rent those darling little skating skirts,” old Sally said. “Jeannette Cultz
did it last week.”
   That's why she was so hot to go. She wanted to see herself in one of those little
skirts that just come down over their butt and all.
   So we went, and after they gave us our skates, they gave Sally this little blue
butt-twitcher of a dress to wear. She really did look damn good in it, though. I save
to admit it. And don't think she didn't know it. The kept walking ahead of me, so
that I'd see how cute her little ass looked. It did look pretty cute, too. I have to
admit it.
   The funny part was, though, we were the worst skaters on the whole goddam rink.
I mean the worst. And there were some lulus, too. Old Sally's ankles kept bending
in till they were practically on the ice. They not only looked stupid as hell, but they
probably hurt like hell, too. I know mine did. Mine were killing me. We must've
looked gorgeous. And what made it worse, there were at least a couple of hundred
rubbernecks that didn't have anything better to do than stand around and watch
everybody falling all over themselves.
   “Do you want to get a table inside and have a drink or something?” I said to her
finally.
   “That's the most marvelous idea you've had all day,” the said. She was killing
herself. It was brutal. I really felt sorry for her.
   We took off our goddam skates and went inside this bar where you can get drinks
and watch the skaters in just your stocking feet. As soon as we sat down, old Sally
took off her gloves, and I gave her a cigarette. She wasn't looking too happy. The
waiter came up, and I ordered a Coke for her—she didn't drink—and a Scotch and
soda for myself, but the sonuvabitch wouldn't bring me one, so I had a Coke, too.
Then I sort of started lighting matches. I do that quite a lot when I'm in a certain
mood. I sort of let them burn down till I can't hold them any more, then I drop
them in the ashtray. It's a nervous habit.
   Then all of a sudden, out of a clear blue sky, old Sally said, “Look. I have to
know. Are you or aren't you coming over to help me trim the tree Christmas Eve?
I have to know.” She was still being snotty on account of her ankles when she was
skating.



                                          75
  “I wrote you I would. You've asked me that about twenty times. Sure, I am.”
   “I mean I have to know,” she said. She started looking all around the goddam
room.
   All of a sudden I quit lighting matches, and sort of leaned nearer to her over the
table. I had quite a few topics on my mind. “Hey, Sally,” I said.
   “What?” she said. She was looking at some girl on the other side of the room.
   “Did you ever get fed up?” I said. “I mean did you ever get scared that everything
was going to go lousy unless you did something? I mean do you like school, and all
that stuff?”
   “It's a terrific bore.”
   “I mean do you hate it? I know it's a terrific bore, but do you hate it, is what I
mean.”
   “Well, I don't exactly hate it. You always have to—”
   “Well, I hate it. Boy, do I hate it,” I said. “But it isn't just that. It's everything.
I hate living in New York and all. Taxicabs, and Madison Avenue buses, with the
drivers and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door, and being introduced
to phony guys that call the Lunts angels, and going up and down in elevators when
you just want to go outside, and guys fitting your pants all the time at Brooks, and
people always—”
   “Don't shout, please,” old Sally said. Which was very funny, because I wasn't
even shouting.
   “Take cars,” I said. I said it in this very quiet voice. “Take most people, they're
crazy about cars. They worry if they get a little scratch on them, and they're always
talking about how many miles they get to a gallon, and if they get a brand-new car
already they start thinking about trading it in for one that's even newer. I don't
even like old cars. I mean they don't even interest me. I'd rather have a goddam
horse. A horse is at least human, for God's sake. A horse you can at least—”
   “I don't know what you're even talking about,” old Sally said. “You jump from
one—”
   “You know something?” I said. “You're probably the only reason I'm in New
York right now, or anywhere. If you weren't around, I'd probably be someplace
way the hell off. In the woods or some goddam place. You're the only reason I'm
around, practically.”
   “You're sweet,” she said. But you could tell she wanted me to change the damn
subject.
   “You ought to go to a boys' school sometime. Try it sometime,” I said. “It's full
of phonies, and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough
to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day, and you have to keep making believe
you give a damn if the football team loses, and all you do is talk about girls and
liquor and sex all day, and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam
cliques. The guys that are on the basketball team stick together, the Catholics stick
together, the goddam intellectuals stick together, the guys that play bridge stick
together. Even the guys that belong to the goddam Book-of-the-Month Club stick
together. If you try to have a little intelligent—”



                                           76

  “Now, listen,” old Sally said. “Lots of boys get more out of school than that.”
   “I agree! I agree they do, some of them! But that's all I get out of it. See? That's
my point. That's exactly my goddam point,” I said. “I don't get hardly anything
out of anything. I'm in bad shape. I'm in lousy shape.”
   “You certainly are.”
   Then, all of a sudden, I got this idea.
   “Look,” I said. “Here's my idea. How would you like to get the hell out of here?
Here's my idea. I know this guy down in Greenwich Village that we can borrow
his car for a couple of weeks. He used to go to the same school I did and he still
owes me ten bucks. What we could do is, tomorrow morning we could drive up
to Massachusetts and Vermont, and all around there, see. It's beautiful as hell up
there, It really is.” I was getting excited as hell, the more I thought of it, and I
sort of reached over and took old Sally's goddam hand. What a goddam fool I was.
“No kidding,” I said. “I have about a hundred and eighty bucks in the bank. I can
take it out when it opens in the morning, and then I could go down and get this
guy's car. No kidding. We'll stay in these cabin camps and stuff like that till the
dough runs out. Then, when the dough runs out, I could get a job somewhere and
we could live somewhere with a brook and all and, later on, we could get married
or something. I could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all. Honest to
God, we could have a terrific time! Wuddaya say? C'mon! Wuddaya say? Will you
do it with me? Please!”
   “You can't just do something like that,” old Sally said. She sounded sore as hell.
   “Why not? Why the hell not?”
   “Stop screaming at me, please,” she said. Which was crap, because I wasn't even
screaming at her.
   “Why can'tcha? Why not?”
   “Because you can't, that's all. In the first place, we're both practically child ren.
And did you ever stop to think what you'd do if you didn't get a job when your
money ran out? We'd starve to death. The whole thing's so fantastic, it isn't
even—”
   “It isn't fantastic. I'd get a job. Don't worry about that. You don't have to
worry about that. What's the matter? Don't you want to go with me? Say so, if
you don't.”
   “It isn't that. It isn't that at all,” old Sally said. I was beginning to hate her, in
a way. “We'll have oodles of time to do those things—all those things. I mean after
you go to college and all, and if we should get married and all. There'll be oodles
of marvelous places to go to. You're just—”
   “No, there wouldn't be. There wouldn't be oodles of places to go to at all. It'd
be entirely different,” I said. I was getting depressed as hell again.
   “What?” she said. “I can't hear you. One minute you scream at me, and the
next you—”
   “I said no, there wouldn't be marvelous places to go to after I went to college
and all. Open your ears. It'd be entirely different. We'd have to go downstairs in
elevators with suitcases and stuff. We'd have to phone up everybody and tell 'em



                                           77

good-by and send 'em postcards from hotels and all. And I'd be working in some
office, making a lot of dough, and riding to work in cabs and Madison Avenue buses,
and reading newspapers, and playing bridge all the time, and going to the movies
and seeing a lot of stupid shorts and coming attractions and newsreels. Newsreels.
Christ almighty. There's always a dumb horse race, and some dame breaking a
bottle over a ship, and some chimpanzee riding a goddam bicycle with pants on. It
wouldn't be the same at all. You don't see what I mean at all.”
   “Maybe I don't! Maybe you don't, either,” old Sally said. We both hated each
other's guts by that time. You could see there wasn't any sense trying to have an
intelligent conversation. I was sorry as hell I'd started it.
   “C'mon, let's get outa here,” I said. “You give me a royal pain in the ass, if you
want to know the truth.”
   Boy, did she hit the ceiling when I said that. I know I shouldn't've said it, and I
probably wouldn't've ordinarily, but she was depressing the hell out of me. Usually
I never say crude things like that to girls. Boy, did she hit the ceiling. I apologized
like a madman, but she wouldn't accept my apology. She was even crying. Which
scared me a little bit, because I was a little afraid she'd go home and tell her father
I called her a pain in the ass. Her father was one of those big silent bastards, and he
wasn't too crazy about me anyhow. He once told old Sally I was too goddam noisy.
   “No kidding. I'm sorry,” I kept telling her.
   “You're sorry. You're sorry. That's very funny,” she said. She was still sort of
crying, and all of a sudden I did feel sort of sorry I'd said it.
   “C'mon, I'll take ya home. No kidding.”
   “I can go home by myself, thank you. If you think I'd let you take me home,
you're mad. No boy ever said that to me in my entire life.”
   The whole thing was sort of funny, in a way, if you thought about it, and all of a
sudden I did something I shouldn't have. I laughed. And I have one of these very
loud, stupid laughs. I mean if I ever sat behind myself in a movie or something, I'd
probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up. It made old Sally madder than
ever.
   I stuck around for a while, apologizing and trying to get her to excuse me, but
she wouldn't. She kept telling me to go away and leave her alone. So finally I did
it. I went inside and got my shoes and stuff, and left without her. I shouldn't've,
but I was pretty goddam fed up by that time.
   If you want to know the truth, I don't even know why I started all that stuff with
her. I mean about going away somewhere, to Massachusetts and Vermont and all.
I probably wouldn't've taken her even if she'd wanted to go with me. She wouldn't
have been anybody to go with. The terrible part, though, is that I meant it when I
asked her. That's the terrible part. I swear to God I'm a madman.


18
When I left the skating rink I felt sort of hungry, so I went in this drugstore and had
a Swiss cheese sandwich and a malted, and then I went in a phone booth. I thought



                                          78

maybe I might give old Jane another buzz and see if she was home yet. I mean I
had the whole evening free, and I thought I'd give her a buzz and, if she was home
yet, take her dancing or something somewhere. I never danced with her or anything
the whole time I knew her. I saw her dancing once, though. She looked like a very
good dancer. It was at this Fourth of July dance at the club. I didn't know her
too well then, and I didn't think I ought to cut in on her date. She was dating
this terrible guy, Al Pike, that went to Choate. I didn't know him too well, but he
was always hanging around the swimming pool. He wore those white Lastex kind of
swimming trunks, and he was always going off the high dive. He did the same lousy
old half gainer all day long. It was the only dive he could do, but he thought he
was very hot stuff. All muscles and no brains. Anyway, that's who Jane dated that
night. I couldn't understand it. I swear I couldn't. After we started going around
together, I asked her how come she could date a showoff bastard like Al Pike. Jane
said he wasn't a show-off. She said he had an inferiority complex. She acted like
she felt sorry for him or something, and she wasn't just putting it on. She meant it.
It's a funny thing about girls. Every time you mention some guy that's strictly a
bastard—very mean, or very conceited and all—and when you mention it to the girl,
she'll tell you he has an inferiority complex. Maybe he has, but that still doesn't
keep him from being a bastard, in my opinion. Girls. You never know what they're
going to think. I once got this girl Roberta Walsh's roommate a date with a friend
of mine. His name was Bob Robinson and he really had an inferiority complex.
You could tell he was very ashamed of his parents and all, because they said “he
don't” and “she don't” and stuff like that and they weren't very wealthy. But he
wasn't a bastard or anything. He was a very nice guy. But this Roberta Walsh's
roommate didn't like him at all. She told Roberta he was too conceited—and the
reason she thought he was conceited was because he happened to mention to her
that he was captain of the debating team. A little thing like that, and she thought
he was conceited! The trouble with girls is, if they like a boy, no matter how big a
bastard he is, they'll say he has an inferiority complex, and if they don't like him,
no matter how nice a guy he is, or how big an inferiority complex he has, they'll say
he's conceited. Even smart girls do it.
   Anyway, I gave old Jane a buzz again, but her phone didn't answer, so I had to
hang up. Then I had to look through my address book to see who the hell might be
available for the evening. The trouble was, though, my address book only has about
three people in it. Jane, and this man, Mr. Antolini, that was my teacher at Elkton
Hills, and my father's office number. I keep forgetting to put people's names in. So
what I did finally, I gave old Carl Luce a buzz. He graduated from the Whooton
School after I left. He was about three years older than I was, and I didn't like
him too much, but he was one of these very intellectual guys— he had the highest
I.Q. of any boy at Whooton—and I thought he might want to have dinner with me
somewhere and have a slightly intellectual conversation. He was very enlightening
sometimes. So I gave him a buzz. He went to Columbia now, but he lived on 65th
Street and all, and I knew he'd be home. When I got him on the phone, he said he
couldn't make it for dinner but that he'd meet me for a drink at ten o'clock at the



Wicker Bar, on 54th. I think he was pretty surprised to hear from me. I once called
him a fat-assed phony.
   I had quite a bit of time to kill till ten o'clock, so what I did, I went to the movies
at Radio City. It was probably the worst thing I could've done, but it was near, and
I couldn't think of anything else.
   I came in when the goddam stage show was on. The Rockettes were kicking their
heads off, the way they do when they're all in line with their arms around each
other's waist. The audience applauded like mad, and some guy behind me kept
saying to his wife, “You know what that is? That's precision.” He killed me. Then,
after the Rockettes, a guy came out in a tuxedo and roller skates on, and started
skating under a bunch of little tables, and telling jokes while he did it. He was a
very good skater and all, but I couldn't enjoy it much because I kept picturing him
practicing to be a guy that roller-skates on the stage. It seemed so stupid. I guess
I just wasn't in the right mood. Then, after him, they had this Christmas thing
they have at Radio City every year. All these angels start coming out of the boxes
and everywhere, guys carrying crucifixes and stuff all over the place, and the whole
bunch of them—thousands of them—singing “Come All Ye Faithful!” like mad. Big
deal. It's supposed to be religious as hell, I know, and very pretty and all, but I can't
see anything religious or pretty, for God's sake, about a bunch of actors carrying
crucifixes all over the stage. When they were all finished and started going out the
boxes again, you could tell they could hardly wait to get a cigarette or something.
I saw it with old Sally Hayes the year before, and she kept saying how beautiful it
was, the costumes and all. I said old Jesus probably would've puked if He could
see it—all those fancy costumes and all. Sally said I was a sacrilegious atheist. I
probably am. The thing Jesus really would've liked would be the guy that plays the
kettle drums in the orchestra. I've watched that guy since I was about eight years
old. My brother Allie and I, if we were with our parents and all, we used to move
our seats and go way down so we could watch him. He's the best drummer I ever
saw. He only gets a chance to bang them a couple of times during a whole piece,
but he never looks bored when he isn't doing it. Then when he does bang them, he
does it so nice and sweet, with this nervous expression on his face. One time when
we went to Washington with my father, Allie sent him a postcard, but I'll bet he
never got it. We weren't too sure how to address it.
   After the Christmas thing was over, the goddam picture started. It was so putrid
I couldn't take my eyes off it. It was about this English guy, Alec something, that
was in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all. He comes out of
the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place, all over London, not
knowing who the hell he is. He's really a duke, but he doesn't know it. Then he
meets this nice, homey, sincere girl getting on a bus. Her goddam hat blows off
and he catches it, and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about
Charles Dickens. He's both their favorite author and all. He's carrying this copy of
Oliver Twist and so's she. I could've puked. Anyway, they fell in love right away, on
account of they're both so nuts about Charles Dickens and all, and he helps her run
her publishing business. She's a publisher, the girl. Only, she's not doing so hot,



                                           80

because her brother's a drunkard and he spends all their dough. He's a very bitter
guy, the brother, because he was a doctor in the war and now he can't operate any
more because his nerves are shot, so he boozes all the time, but he's pretty witty
and all. Anyway, old Alec writes a book, and this girl publishes it, and they both
make a hatful of dough on it. They're all set to get married when this other girl,
old Marcia, shows up. Marcia was Alec's fiancée before he lost his memory, and
she recognizes him when he's in this store autographing books. She tells old Alec
he's really a duke and all, but he doesn't believe her and doesn't want to go with
her to visit his mother and all. His mother's blind as a bat. But the other girl,
the homey one, makes him go. She's very noble and all. So he goes. But he still
doesn't get his memory back, even when his great Dane jumps all over him and his
mother sticks her fingers all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to
slobber around with when he was a kid. But then, one day, some kids are playing
cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with a cricket ball. Then right
away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and kisses his mother on
the forehead and all. Then he starts being a regular duke again, and he forgets all
about the homey babe that has the publishing business. I'd tell you the rest of the
story, but I might puke if I did. It isn't that I'd spoil it for you or anything. There
isn't anything to spoil, for Chrissake. Anyway, it ends up with Alec and the homey
babe getting married, and the brother that's a drunkard gets his nerves back and
operates on Alec's mother so she can see again, and then the drunken brother and
old Marcia go for each other. It ends up with everybody at this long dinner table
laughing their asses off because the great Dane comes in with a bunch of puppies.
Everybody thought it was a male, I suppose, or some goddam thing. All I can say
is, don't see it if you don't want to puke all over yourself.
   The part that got me was, there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all
through the goddam picture. The phonier it got, the more she cried. You'd have
thought she did it because she was kindhearted as hell, but I was sitting right next
to her, and she wasn't. She had this little kid with her that was bored as hell and
had to go to the bathroom, but she wouldn't take him. She kept telling him to sit
still and behave himself. She was about as kindhearted as a goddam wolf. You take
somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies, and nine
times out of ten they're mean bastards at heart. I'm not kidding.
   After the movie was over, I started walking down to the Wicker Bar, where I was
supposed to meet old Carl Luce, and while I walked I sort of thought about war
and all. Those war movies always do that to me. I don't think I could stand it if
I had to go to war. I really couldn't. It wouldn't be too bad if they'd just take
you out and shoot you or something, but you have to stay in the Army so goddam
long. That's the whole trouble. My brother D.B. was in the Army for four goddam
years. He was in the war, too—he landed on D-Day and all—but I really think he
hated the Army worse than the war. I was practically a child at the time, but I
remember when he used to come home on furlough and all, all he did was lie on
his bed, practically. He hardly ever even came in the living room. Later, when he
went overseas and was in the war and all, he didn't get wounded or anything and



                                          81
he didn't have to shoot anybody. All he had to do was drive some cowboy general
around all day in a command car. He once told Allie and I that if he'd had to shoot
anybody, he wouldn't've known which direction to shoot in. He said the Army was
practically as full of bastards as the Nazis were. I remember Allie once asked him
wasn't it sort of good that he was in the war because he was a writer and it gave
him a lot to write about and all. He made Allie go get his baseball mitt and then he
asked him who was the best war poet, Rupert Brooke or Emily Dickinson. Allie said
Emily Dickinson. I don't know too much about it myself, because I don't read much
poetry, but I do know it'd drive me crazy if I had to be in the Army and be with
a bunch of guys like Ackley and Stradlater and old Maurice all the time, marching
with them and all. I was in the Boy Scouts once, for about a week, and I couldn't
even stand looking at the back of the guy's neck in front of me. They kept telling
you to look at the back of the guy's neck in front of you. I swear if there's ever
another war, they better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing squad. I
wouldn't object. What gets me about D.B., though, he hated the war so much, and
yet he got me to read this book A Farewell to Arms last summer. He said it was
so terrific. That's what I can't understand. It had this guy in it named Lieutenant
Henry that was supposed to be a nice guy and all. I don't see how D.B. could hate
the Army and war and all so much and still like a phony like that. I mean, for
instance, I don't see how he could like a phony book like that and still like that one
by Ring Lardner, or that other one he's so crazy about, The Great Gatsby. D.B.
got sore when I said that, and said I was too young and all to appreciate it, but I
don't think so. I told him I liked Ring Lardner and The Great Gatsby and all. I
did, too. I was crazy about The Great Gatsby. Old Gatsby. Old sport. That killed
me. Anyway, I'm sort of glad they've got the atomic bomb invented. If there's ever
another war, I'm going to sit right the hell on top of it. I'll volunteer for it, I swear
to God I will.

In case you don't live in New York, the Wicker Bar is in this sort of swanky hotel,
the Seton Hotel. I used to go there quite a lot, but I don't any more. I gradually
cut it out. It's one of those places that are supposed to be very sophisticated and
all, and the phonies are coming in the window. They used to have these two French
babes, Tina and Janine, come out and play the piano and sing about three times
every night. One of them played the piano—strictly lousy—and the other one sang,
and most of the songs were either pretty dirty or in French. The one that sang, old
Janine, was always whispering into the goddam microphone before she sang. She'd
say, “And now we like to geeve you our impression of Vooly Voo Fransay. Eet ees
the story of a leetle Fransh girl who comes to a beeg ceety, just like New York, and
falls een love wees a leetle boy from Brookleen. We hope you like eet.” Then, when
she was all done whispering and being cute as hell, she'd sing some dopey song, half
in English and half in French, and drive all the phonies in the place mad with joy. If
you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and all, you



                                           82

got to hate everybody in the world, I swear you did. The bartender was a louse, too.
He was a big snob. He didn't talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or
a celebrity or something. If you were a big shot or a celebrity or something, then
he was even more nauseating. He'd go up to you and say, with this big charming
smile, like he was a helluva swell guy if you knew him, “Well! How's Connecticut?”
or “How's Florida?” It was a terrible place, I'm not kidding. I cut out going there
entirely, gradually.
   It was pretty early when I got there. I sat down at the bar—it was pretty
crowded—and had a couple of Scotch and sodas before old Luce even showed up.
I stood up when I ordered them so they could see how tall I was and all and not
think I was a goddam minor. Then I watched the phonies for a while. Some guy
next to me was snowing hell out of the babe he was with. He kept telling her
she had aristocratic hands. That killed me. The other end of the bar was full of
flits. They weren't too flitty-looking—I mean they didn't have their hair too long
or anything—but you could tell they were flits anyway. Finally old Luce showed up.
   Old Luce. What a guy. He was supposed to be my Student Adviser when I was at
Whooton. The only thing he ever did, though, was give these sex talks and all, late
at night when there was a bunch of guys in his room. He knew quite a bit about
sex, especially perverts and all. He was always telling us about a lot of creepy guys
that go around having affairs with sheep, and guys that go around with girls' pants
sewed in the lining of their hats and all. And flits and Lesbians. Old Luce knew
who every flit and Lesbian in the United States was. All you had to do was mention
somebody—anybody—and old Luce'd tell you if he was a flit or not. Sometimes it
was hard to believe, the people he said were flits and Lesbians and all, movie actors
and like that. Some of the ones he said were flits were even married, for God's sake.
You'd keep saying to him, “You mean Joe Blow's a flit? Joe Blow? That big, tough
guy that plays gangsters and cowboys all the time?” Old Luce'd say, “Certainly.”
He was always saying “Certainly.” He said it didn't matter if a guy was married
or not. He said half the married guys in the world were flits and didn't even know
it. He said you could turn into one practically overnight, if you had all the traits
and all. He used to scare the hell out of us. I kept waiting to turn into a flit or
something. The funny thing about old Luce, I used to think he was sort of flitty
himself, in a way. He was always saying, “Try this for size,” and then he'd goose
the hell out of you while you were going down the corridor. And whenever he went
to the can, he always left the goddam door open and talked to you while you were
brushing your teeth or something. That stuff's sort of flitty. It really is. I've known
quite a few real flits, at schools and all, and they're always doing stuff like that, and
that's why I always had my doubts about old Luce. He was a pretty intelligent guy,
though. He really was.
   He never said hello or anything when he met you. The first thing he said when he
sat down was that he could only stay a couple of minutes. He said he had a date.
Then he ordered a dry Martini. He told the bartender to make it very dry, and no
olive.




                                           83

“Hey, I got a flit for you,” I told him. “At the end of the bar. Don't look now. I
been saving him for ya.”
  “Very funny,” he said. “Same old Caulfield. When are you going to grow up?”
  I bored him a lot. I really did. He amused me, though. He was one of those guys
that sort of amuse me a lot.
  “How's your sex life?” I asked him. He hated you to ask him stuff like that.
  “Relax,” he said. “Just sit back and relax, for Chrissake.”
  “I'm relaxed,” I said. “How's Columbia? Ya like it?”
  “Certainly I like it. If I didn't like it I wouldn't have gone there,” he said. He
could be pretty boring himself sometimes.
  “What're you majoring in?” I asked him. “Perverts?” I was only horsing around.
  “What're you trying to be—funny?”
  “No. I'm only kidding,” I said. “Listen, hey, Luce. You're one of these intellectual
guys. I need your advice. I'm in a terrific—”
  He let out this big groan on me. “Listen, Caulfield. If you want to sit here and
have a quiet, peaceful drink and a quiet, peaceful conver—”
  “All right, all right,” I said. “Relax.” You could tell he didn't feel like discussing
anything serious with me. That's the trouble with these intellectual guys. They
never want to discuss anything serious unless they feel like it. So all I did was, I
started discussing topics in general with him. “No kidding, how's your sex life?” I
asked him. “You still going around with that same babe you used to at Whooton?
The one with the terrific—”
  “Good God, no,” he said.
  “How come? What happened to her?”
  “I haven't the faintest idea. For all I know, since you ask, she's probably the
Whore of New Hampshire by this time.”
  “That isn't nice. If she was decent enough to let you get sexy with her all the
time, you at least shouldn't talk about her that way.”
  “Oh, God!” old Luce said. “Is this going to be a typical Caulfield conversation?
I want to know right now.”
  “No,” I said, “but it isn't nice anyway. If she was decent and nice enough to let
you—”
  “Must we pursue this horrible trend of thought?”
  I didn't say anything. I was sort of afraid he'd get up and leave on me if I didn't
shut up. So all I did was, I ordered another drink. I felt like getting stinking drunk.
  “Who're you going around with now?” I asked him. “You feel like telling me?”
  “Nobody you know.”
  “Yeah, but who? I might know her.”
  “Girl lives in the Village. Sculptress. If you must know.”
  “Yeah? No kidding? How old is she?”
  “I've never asked her, for God's sake.”
  “Well, around how old?”
  “I should imagine she's in her late thirties,” old Luce said.




                                          84
  “In her late thirties? Yeah? You like that?” I asked him. “You like 'em that
old?” The reason I was asking was because he really knew quite a bit about sex and
all. He was one of the few guys I knew that did. He lost his virginity when he was
only fourteen, in Nantucket. He really did.
   “I like a mature person, if that's what you mean. Certainly.”
   “You do? Why? No kidding, they better for sex and all?”
   “Listen. Let's get one thing straight. I refuse to answer any typical Caulfield
questions tonight. When in hell are you going to grow up?”
   I didn't say anything for a while. I let it drop for a while. Then old Luce ordered
another Martini and told the bartender to make it a lot dryer.
   “Listen. How long you been going around with her, this sculpture babe?” I asked
him. I was really interested. “Did you know her when you were at Whooton?”
   “Hardly. She just arrived in this country a few months ago.”
   “She did? Where's she from?”
   “She happens to be from Shanghai.”
   “No kidding! She Chinese, for Chrissake?”
   “Obviously.”
   “No kidding! Do you like that? Her being Chinese?”
   “Obviously.”
   “Why? I'd be interested to know—I really would.”
   “I simply happen to find Eastern philosophy more satisfactory than Western.
Since you ask.”
   “You do? Wuddaya mean ‘philosophy' ? Ya mean sex and all? You mean it's
better in China? That what you mean?”
   “Not necessarily in China, for God's sake. The East I said. Must we go on with
this inane conversation?”
   “Listen, I'm serious,” I said. “No kidding. Why's it better in the East?”
   “It's too involved to go into, for God's sake,” old Luce said. “They simply happen
to regard sex as both a physical and a spiritual experience. If you think I'm—”
   “So do I! So do I regard it as a wuddayacallit—a physical and spiritual experience
and all. I really do. But it depends on who the hell I'm doing it with. If I'm doing
it with somebody I don't even—”
   “Not so loud, for God's sake, Caulfield. If you can't manage to keep your voice
down, let's drop the whole—”
   “All right, but listen,” I said. I was getting excited and I was talking a little
too loud. Sometimes I talk a little loud when I get excited. “This is what I mean,
though,” I said. “I know it's supposed to be physical and spiritual, and artistic and
all. But what I mean is, you can't do it with everybody—every girl you neck with
and all—and make it come out that way. Can you?”
   “Let's drop it,” old Luce said. “Do you mind?”
   “All right, but listen. Take you and this Chinese babe. What's so good about
you two?”
   “Drop it, I said.”




                                         85
  I was getting a little too personal. I realize that. But that was one of the an-
noying things about Luce. When we were at Whooton, he'd make you describe the
most personal stuff that happened to you, but if you started asking him questions
about himself, he got sore. These intellectual guys don't like to have an intellectual
conversation with you unless they're running the whole thing. They always want
you to shut up when they shut up, and go back to your room when they go back
to their room. When I was at Whooton old Luce used to hate it—you really could
tell he did—when after he was finished giving his sex talk to a bunch of us in his
room we stuck around and chewed the fat by ourselves for a while. I mean the other
guys and myself. In somebody else's room. Old Luce hated that. He always wanted
everybody to go back to their own room and shut up when he was finished being
the big shot. The thing he was afraid of, he was afraid somebody'd say something
smarter than he had. He really amused me.
   “Maybe I'll go to China. My sex life is lousy,” I said.
   “Naturally. Your mind is immature.”
   “It is. It really is. I know it,” I said. “You know what the trouble with me is? I
can never get really sexy—I mean really sexy—with a girl I don't like a lot. I mean
I have to like her a lot. If I don't, I sort of lose my goddam desire for her and all.
Boy, it really screws up my sex life something awful. My sex life stinks.”
   “Naturally it does, for God's sake. I told you the last time I saw you what you
need.”
   “You mean to go to a psychoanalyst and all?” I said. That's what he'd told me
I ought to do. His father was a psychoanalyst and all.
   “It's up to you, for God's sake. It's none of my goddam business what you do
with your life.”
   I didn't say anything for a while. I was thinking.
   “Supposing I went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all,” I said.
“What would he do to me? I mean what would he do to me?”
   “He wouldn't do a goddam thing to you. He'd simply talk to you, and you'd talk
to him, for God's sake. For one thing, he'd help you to recognize the patterns of
your mind.”
   “The what?”
   “The patterns of your mind. Your mind runs in— Listen. I'm not giving an
elementary course in psychoanalysis. If you're interested, call him up and make an
appointment. If you're not, don't. I couldn't care less, frankly.”
   I put my hand on his shoulder. Boy, he amused me. “You're a real friendly
bastard,” I told him. “You know that?”
   He was looking at his wrist watch. “I have to tear,” he said, and stood up. “Nice
seeing you.” He got the bartender and told him to bring him his check.
   “Hey,” I said, just before he beat it. “Did your father ever psychoanalyze you?”
   “Me? Why do you ask?”
   “No reason. Did he, though? Has he?”
   “Not exactly. He's helped me to adjust myself to a certain extent, but an extensive
analysis hasn't been necessary. Why do you ask?”



                                         86
  “No reason. I was just wondering.”
  “Well. Take it easy,” he said. He was leaving his tip and all and he was starting
to go.
  “Have just one more drink,” I told him. “Please. I'm lonesome as hell. No
kidding.”
  He said he couldn't do it, though. He said he was late now, and then he left.
  Old Luce. He was strictly a pain in the ass, but he certainly had a good vocabulary.
He had the largest vocabulary of any boy at Whooton when I was there. They gave
us a test.

I kept sitting there getting drunk and waiting for old Tina and Janine to come out
and do their stuff, but they weren't there. A flitty-looking guy with wavy hair came
out and played the piano, and then this new babe, Valencia, came out and sang.
She wasn't any good, but she was better than old Tina and Janine, and at least she
sang good songs. The piano was right next to the bar where I was sitting and all,
and old Valencia was standing practically right next to me. I sort of gave her the
old eye, but she pretended she didn't even see me. I probably wouldn't have done it,
but I was getting drunk as hell. When she was finished, she beat it out of the room
so fast I didn't even get a chance to invite her to join me for a drink, so I called the
headwaiter over. I told him to ask old Valencia if she'd care to join me for a drink.
He said he would, but he probably didn't even give her my message. People never
give your message to anybody.
   Boy, I sat at that goddam bar till around one o'clock or so, getting drunk as a
bastard. I could hardly see straight. The one thing I did, though, I was careful
as hell not to get boisterous or anything. I didn't want anybody to notice me or
anything or ask how old I was. But, boy, I could hardly see straight. When I was
really drunk, I started that stupid business with the bullet in my guts again. I was
the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their guts. I kept putting my hand under my
jacket, on my stomach and all, to keep the blood from dripping all over the place.
I didn't want anybody to know I was even wounded. I was conceal ing the fact that
I was a wounded sonuvabitch. Finally what I felt like, I felt like giving old Jane a
buzz and see if she was home yet. So I paid my check and all. Then I left the bar
and went out where the telephones were. I kept keeping my hand under my jacket
to keep the blood from dripping. Boy, was I drunk.
   But when I got inside this phone booth, I wasn't much in the mood any more to
give old Jane a buzz. I was too drunk, I guess. So what I did, I gave old Sally Hayes
a buzz.
   I had to dial about twenty numbers before I got the right one. Boy, was I blind.
   “Hello,” I said when somebody answered the goddam phone. I sort of yelled it, I
was so drunk.
   “Who is this?” this very cold lady's voice said.
   “This is me. Holden Caulfield. Lemme speaka Sally, please.”



                                          87

  “Sally's asleep. This is Sally's grandmother. Why are you calling at this hour,
Holden? Do you know what time it is?”
   “Yeah. Wanna talka Sally. Very important. Put her on.”
   “Sally's asleep, young man. Call her tomorrow. Good night.”
   “Wake 'er up! Wake 'er up, hey. Attaboy.”
   Then there was a different voice. “Holden, this is me.” It was old Sally. “What's
the big idea?”
   “Sally? That you?”
   “Yes—stop screaming. Are you drunk?”
   “Yeah. Listen. Listen, hey. I'll come over Christmas Eve. Okay? Trimma
goddarn tree for ya. Okay? Okay, hey, Sally?”
   “Yes. You're drunk. Go to bed now. Where are you? Who's with you?”
   “Sally? I'll come over and trimma tree for ya, okay? Okay, hey?”
   “Yes. Go to bed now. Where are you? Who's with you?”
   “Nobody. Me, myself and I.” Boy was I drunk! I was even still holding onto my
guts. “They got me. Rocky's mob got me. You know that? Sally, you know that?”
   “I can't hear you. Go to bed now. I have to go. Call me tomorrow.”
   “Hey, Sally! You want me trimma tree for ya? Ya want me to? Huh? ”
   “Yes. Good night. Go home and go to bed.”
   She hung up on me.
   “G'night. G'night, Sally baby. Sally sweetheart darling,” I said. Can you imagine
how drunk I was? I hung up too, then. I figured she probably just came home from
a date. I pictured her out with the Lunts and all somewhere, and that Andover
jerk. All of them swimming around in a goddam pot of tea and saying sophisticated
stuff to each other and being charming and phony. I wished to God I hadn't even
phoned her. When I'm drunk, I'm a madman.
   I stayed in the damn phone booth for quite a while. I kept holding onto the phone,
sort of, so I wouldn't pass out. I wasn't feeling too marvelous, to tell you the truth.
Finally, though, I came out and went in the men's room, staggering around like a
moron, and filled one of the washbowls with cold water. Then I dunked my head
in it, right up to the ears. I didn't even bother to dry it or anything. I just let the
sonuvabitch drip. Then I walked over to this radiator by the window and sat down
on it. It was nice and warm. It felt good because I was shivering like a bastard. It's
a funny thing, I always shiver like hell when I'm drunk.
   I didn't have anything else to do, so I kept sitting on the radiator and counting
these little white squares on the floor. I was getting soaked. About a gallon of water
was dripping down my neck, getting all over my collar and tie and all, but I didn't
give a damn. I was too drunk to give a damn. Then, pretty soon, the guy that
played the piano for old Valencia, this very wavyhaired, flitty-looking guy, came in
to comb his golden locks. We sort of struck up a conversation while he was combing
it, except that he wasn't too goddam friendly.
   “Hey. You gonna see that Valencia babe when you go back in the bar?” I asked
him.
   “It's highly probable,” he said. Witty bastard. All I ever meet is witty bastards.



                                          88

  “Listen. Give her my compliments. Ask her if that goddam waiter gave her my
message, willya?”
   “Why don't you go home, Mac? How old are you, anyway?”
   “Eighty-six. Listen. Give her my compliments. Okay?”
   “Why don't you go home, Mac?”
   “Not me. Boy, you can play that goddam piano.” I told him. I was just flattering
him. He played the piano stinking, if you want to know the truth. “You oughta go
on the radio,” I said. “Handsome chap like you. All those goddam golden locks. Ya
need a manager?”
   “Go home, Mac, like a good guy. Go home and hit the sack.”
   “No home to go to. No kidding—you need a manager?”
   He didn't answer me. He just went out. He was all through combing his hair
and patting it and all, so he left. Like Stradlater. All these handsome guys are the
same. When they're done combing their goddam hair, they beat it on you.
   When I finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hat-check room,
I was crying and all. I don't know why, but I was. I guess it was because I was
feeling so damn depressed and lonesome. Then, when I went out to the checkroom,
I couldn't find my goddam check. The hat-check girl was very nice about it, though.
She gave me my coat anyway. And my “Little Shirley Beans” record—I still had it
with me and all. I gave her a buck for being so nice, but she wouldn't take it. She
kept telling me to go home and go to bed. I sort of tried to make a date with her for
when she got through working, but she wouldn't do it. She said she was old enough
to be my mother and all. I showed her my goddam gray hair and told her I was
forty-two—I was only horsing around, naturally. She was nice, though. I showed
her my goddam red hunting hat, and she liked it. She made me put it on before I
went out, because my hair was still pretty wet. She was all right.
   I didn't feel too drunk any more when I went outside, but it was getting very cold
out again, and my teeth started chattering like hell. I couldn't make them stop.
I walked over to Madison Avenue and started to wait around for a bus because I
didn't have hardly any money left and I had to start economizing on cabs and all.
But I didn't feel like getting on a damn bus. And besides, I didn't even know where
I was supposed to go. So what I did, I started walking over to the park. I figured
I'd go by that little lake and see what the hell the ducks were doing, see if they were
around or not, I still didn't know if they were around or not. It wasn't far over to
the park, and I didn't have anyplace else special to go to—I didn't even know where
I was going to sleep yet—so I went. I wasn't tired or anything. I just felt blue as
hell.
   Then something terrible happened just as I got in the park. I dropped old
Phoebe's record. It broke-into about fifty pieces. It was in a big envelope and
all, but it broke anyway. I damn near cried, it made me feel so terrible, but all I did
was, I took the pieces out of the envelope and put them in my coat pocket. They
weren't any good for anything, but I didn't feel like just throwing them away. Then
I went in the park. Boy, was it dark.




                                          89

  I've lived in New York all my life, and I know Central Park like the back of my
hand, because I used to roller-skate there all the time and ride my bike when I was a
kid, but I had the most terrific trouble finding that lagoon that night. I knew right
where it was—it was right near Central Park South and all—but I still couldn't find
it. I must've been drunker than I thought. I kept walking and walking, and it kept
getting darker and darker and spookier and spookier. I didn't see one person the
whole time I was in the park. I'm just as glad. I probably would've jumped about a
mile if I had. Then, finally, I found it. What it was, it was partly frozen and partly
not frozen. But I didn't see any ducks around. I walked all around the whole damn
lake—I damn near fell in once, in fact—but I didn't see a single duck. I thought
maybe if there were any around, they might be asleep or something near the edge
of the water, near the grass and all. That's how I nearly fell in. But I couldn't find
any.
   Finally I sat down on this bench, where it wasn't so goddam dark. Boy, I was still
shivering like a bastard, and the back of my hair, even though I had my hunting hat
on, was sort of full of little hunks of ice. That worried me. I thought probably I'd
get pneumonia and die. I started picturing millions of jerks coming to my funeral
and all. My grandfather from Detroit, that keeps calling out the numbers of the
streets when you ride on a goddam bus with him, and my aunts—I have about fifty
aunts—and all my lousy cousins. What a mob'd be there. They all came when
Allie died, the whole goddam stupid bunch of them. I have this one stupid aunt
with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he looked lying there, D.B. told me. I
wasn't there. I was still in the hospital. I had to go to the hospital and all after
I hurt my hand. Anyway, I kept worrying that I was getting pneumonia, with all
those hunks of ice in my hair, and that I was going to die. I felt sorry as hell for my
mother and father. Especially my mother, because she still isn't over my brother
Allie yet. I kept picturing her not knowing what to do with all my suits and athletic
equipment and all. The only good thing, I knew she wouldn't let old Phoebe come
to my goddam funeral because she was only a little kid. That was the only good
part. Then I thought about the whole bunch of them sticking me in a goddam
cemetery and all, with my name on this tombstone and all. Surrounded by dead
guys. Boy, when you're dead, they really fix you up. I hope to hell when I do die
somebody has sense enough to just dump me in the river or something. Anything
except sticking me in a goddam cemetery. People coming and putting a bunch of
flowers on your stomach on Sunday, and all that crap. Who wants flowers when
you're dead? Nobody.
   When the weather's nice, my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch
of flowers on old Allie's grave. I went with them a couple of times, but I cut it
out. In the first place, I certainly don't enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery.
Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all. It wasn't too bad when the sun
was out, but twice—twice—we were there when it started to rain. It was awful. It
rained on his lousy tombstone, and it rained on the grass on his stomach. It rained
all over the place. All the visitors that were visiting the cemetery started running
like hell over to their cars. That's what nearly drove me crazy. All the visitors could



                                          90

get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then go someplace nice for
dinner—everybody except Allie. I couldn't stand it. I know it's only his body and
all that's in the cemetery, and his soul's in Heaven and all that crap, but I couldn't
stand it anyway. I just wish he wasn't there. You didn't know him. If you'd known
him, you'd know what I mean. It's not too bad when the sun's out, but the sun
only comes out when it feels like coming out.
   After a while, just to get my mind off getting pneumonia and all, I took out my
dough and tried to count it in the lousy light from the street lamp. All I had was
three singles and five quarters and a nickel left—boy, I spent a fortune since I left
Pencey. Then what I did, I went down near the lagoon and I sort of skipped the
quarters and the nickel across it, where it wasn't frozen. I don't know why I did it,
but I did it. I guess I thought it'd take my mind off getting pneumonia and dying.
It didn't, though.
   I started thinking how old Phoebe would feel if I got pneumonia and died. It was a
childish way to think, but I couldn't stop myself. She'd feel pretty bad if something
like that happened. She likes me a lot. I mean she's quite fond of me. She really is.
Anyway, I couldn't get that off my mind, so finally what I figured I'd do, I figured
I'd better sneak home and see her, in case I died and all. I had my door key with
me and all, and I figured what I'd do, I'd sneak in the apartment, very quiet and
all, and just sort of chew the fat with her for a while. The only thing that worried
me was our front door. It creaks like a bastard. It's a pretty old apartment house,
and the superintendent's a lazy bastard, and everything creaks and squeaks. I was
afraid my parents might hear me sneaking in. But I decided I'd try it anyhow.
   So I got the hell out of the park, and went home. I walked all the way. It wasn't
too far, and I wasn't tired or even drunk any more. It was just very cold and nobody
around anywhere.


21
The best break I had in years, when I got home the regular night elevator boy, Pete,
wasn't on the car. Some new guy I'd never seen was on the car, so I figured that if
I didn't bump smack into my parents and all I'd be able to say hello to old Phoebe
and then beat it and nobody'd even know I'd been around. It was really a terrific
break. What made it even better, the new elevator boy was sort of on the stupid
side. I told him, in this very casual voice, to take me up to the Dicksteins'. The
Dicksteins were these people that had the other apartment on our floor. I'd already
taken off my hunting hat, so as not to look suspicious or anything. I went in the
elevator like I was in a terrific hurry.
   He had the elevator doors all shut and all, and was all set to take me up, and then
he turned around and said, “They ain't in. They're at a party on the fourteenth
floor.”
   “That's all right,” I said. “I'm supposed to wait for them. I'm their nephew.”
   He gave me this sort of stupid, suspicious look. “You better wait in the lobby,
fella,” he said.



                                         91
  “I'd like to—I really would,” I said. “But I have a bad leg. I have to hold it in a
certain position. I think I'd better sit down in the chair outside their door.”
   He didn't know what the hell I was talking about, so all he said was “Oh” and
took me up. Not bad, boy. It's funny. All you have to do is say something nobody
understands and they'll do practically anything you want them to.
   I got off at our floor—limping like a bastard—and started walking over toward
the Dicksteins' side. Then, when I heard the elevator doors shut, I turned around
and went over to our side. I was doing all right. I didn't even feel drunk anymore.
Then I took out my door key and opened our door, quiet as hell. Then, very, very
carefully and all, I went inside and closed the door. I really should've been a crook.
   It was dark as hell in the foyer, naturally, and naturally I couldn't turn on any
lights. I had to be careful not to bump into anything and make a racket. I certainly
knew I was home, though. Our foyer has a funny smell that doesn't smell like
anyplace else. I don't know what the hell it is. It isn't cauliflower and it isn't
perfume—I don't know what the hell it is—but you always know you're home. I
started to take off my coat and hang it up in the foyer closet, but that closet's full
of hangers that rattle like madmen when you open the door, so I left it on. Then I
started walking very, very slowly back toward old Phoebe's room. I knew the maid
wouldn't hear me because she had only one eardrum. She had this brother that
stuck a straw down her ear when she was a kid, she once told me. She was pretty
deaf and all. But my par ents, especially my mother, she has ears like a goddam
bloodhound. So I took it very, very easy when I went past their door. I even held
my breath, for God's sake. You can hit my father over the head with a chair and he
won't wake up, but my mother, all you have to do to my mother is cough somewhere
in Siberia and she'll hear you. She's nervous as hell. Half the time she's up all night
smoking cigarettes.
   Finally, after about an hour, I got to old Phoebe's room. She wasn't there, though.
I forgot about that. I forgot she always sleeps in D.B.'s room when he's away in
Hollywood or some place. She likes it because it's the biggest room in the house.
Also because it has this big old madman desk in it that D.B. bought off some lady
alcoholic in Philadelphia, and this big, gigantic bed that's about ten miles wide and
ten miles long. I don't know where he bought that bed. Anyway, old Phoebe likes
to sleep in D.B.'s room when he's away, and he lets her. You ought to see her doing
her homework or something at that crazy desk. It's almost as big as the bed. You
can hardly see her when she's doing her homework. That's the kind of stuff she
likes, though. She doesn't like her own room because it's too little, she says. She
says she likes to spread out. That kills me. What's old Phoebe got to spread out?
Nothing.
   Anyway, I went into D.B.'s room quiet as hell, and turned on the lamp on the
desk. Old Phoebe didn't even wake up. When the light was on and all, I sort of
looked at her for a while. She was laying there asleep, with her face sort of on the
side of the pillow. She had her mouth way open. It's funny. You take adults, they
look lousy when they're asleep and they have their mouths way open, but kids don't.




                                          92

Kids look all right. They can even have spit all over the pillow and they still look
all right.
   I went around the room, very quiet and all, looking at stuff for a while. I felt
swell, for a change. I didn't even feel like I was getting pneumonia or anything any
more. I just felt good, for a change. Old Phoebe's clothes were on this chair right
next to the bed. She's very neat, for a child. I mean she doesn't just throw her
stuff around, like some kids. She's no slob. She had the jacket to this tan suit my
mother bought her in Canada hung up on the back of the chair. Then her blouse
and stuff were on the seat. Her shoes and socks were on the floor, right underneath
the chair, right next to each other. I never saw the shoes before. They were new.
They were these dark brown loafers, sort of like this pair I have, and they went swell
with that suit my mother bought her in Canada. My mother dresses her nice. She
really does. My mother has terrific taste in some things. She's no good at buying
ice skates or anything like that, but clothes, she's perfect. I mean Phoebe always
has some dress on that can kill you. You take most little kids, even if their parents
are wealthy and all, they usually have some terrible dress on. I wish you could see
old Phoebe in that suit my mother bought her in Canada. I'm not kidding.
   I sat down on old D.B.'s desk and looked at the stuff on it. It was mostly Phoebe's
stuff, from school and all. Mostly books. The one on top was called Arithmetic Is
Fun! I sort of opened the first page and took a look at it. This is what old Phoebe
had on it:

                      Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield
                                  4B-1

  That killed me. Her middle name is Josephine, for God's sake, not Weatherfield.
She doesn't like it, though. Every time I see her she's got a new middle name for
herself.
  The book underneath the arithmetic was a geography, and the book under the
geography was a speller. She's very good in spelling. She's very good in all her
subjects, but she's best in spelling. Then, under the speller, there were a bunch of
notebooks. She has about five thousand notebooks. You never saw a kid with so
many notebooks. I opened the one on top and looked at the first page. It had on it:

     Bernice meet me at recess I have something
     very very important to tell you.

  That was all there was on that page. The next one had on it:

     Why has south eastern Alaska so many caning factories?
     Because theres so much salmon
     Why has it valuable forests?
     because it has the right climate.
     What has our government done to make
     life easier for the alaskan eskimos?



                                         93
   look it up for tomorrow!!!
             Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield
             Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield
             Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield
             Phoebe W. Caulfield

        Please pass to Shirley!!!!
        Shirley you said you were sagitarius
     but your only taurus bring your skates
     when you come over to my house

   I sat there on D.B.'s desk and read the whole notebook. It didn't take me long,
and I can read that kind of stuff, some kid's notebook, Phoebe's or anybody's, all
day and all night long. Kid's notebooks kill me. Then I lit another cigarette—it
was my last one. I must've smoked about three cartons that day. Then, finally, I
woke her up. I mean I couldn't sit there on that desk for the rest of my life, and
besides, I was afraid my parents might barge in on me all of a sudden and I wanted
to at least say hello to her before they did. So I woke her up.
   She wakes up very easily. I mean you don't have to yell at her or anything. All
you have to do, practically, is sit down on the bed and say, “Wake up, Phoeb,” and
bingo, she's awake.
   “Hold en!” she said right away. She put her arms around my neck and all. She's
very affectionate. I mean she's quite affectionate, for a child. Sometimes she's even
too affectionate. I sort of gave her a kiss, and she said, “Whenja get home? ” She
was glad as hell to see me. You could tell.
   “Not so loud. Just now. How are ya anyway?”
   “I'm fine. Did you get my letter? I wrote you a five-page—”
   “Yeah—not so loud. Thanks.”
   She wrote me this letter. I didn't get a chance to answer it, though. It was all
about this play she was in in school. She told me not to make any dates or anything
for Friday so that I could come see it.
   “How's the play?” I asked her. “What'd you say the name of it was?”
   “ ‘A Christmas Pageant for Americans.' It stinks, but I'm Benedict Arnold. I
have practically the biggest part,” she said. Boy, was she wide-awake. She gets very
excited when she tells you that stuff. “It starts out when I'm dying. This ghost
comes in on Christmas Eve and asks me if I'm ashamed and everything. You know.
For betraying my country and everything. Are you coming to it?” She was sitting
way the hell up in the bed and all. “That's what I wrote you about. Are you?”
   “Sure I'm coming. Certainly I'm coming.”
   “Daddy can't come. He has to fly to California,” she said. Boy, was she wide-
awake. It only takes her about two seconds to get wide-awake. She was sitting—sort
of kneeling—way up in bed, and she was holding my goddam hand. “Listen. Mother
said you'd be home Wednesday,” she said. “She said Wednesday.”
   “I got out early. Not so loud. You'll wake everybody up.”



 “What time is it? They won't be home till very late, Mother said. They went to a
party in Norwalk, Connecticut,” old Phoebe said. “Guess what I did this afternoon!
What movie I saw. Guess!”
   “I don't know—Listen. Didn't they say what time they'd—”
   “The Doctor,” old Phoebe said. “It's a special movie they had at the Lister
Foundation. Just this one day they had it—today was the only day. It was all
about this doctor in Kentucky and everything that sticks a blanket over this child's
face that's a cripple and can't walk. Then they send him to jail and everything. It
was excellent.”
   “Listen a second. Didn't they say what time they'd—”
   “He feels sorry for it, the doctor. That's why he sticks this blanket over her face
and everything and makes her suffocate. Then they make him go to jail for life
imprisonment, but this child that he stuck the blanket over its head comes to visit
him all the time and thanks him for what he did. He was a mercy killer. Only, he
knows he deserves to go to jail because a doctor isn't supposed to take things away
from God. This girl in my class's mother took us. Alice Holmborg, She's my best
friend. She's the only girl in the whole—”
   “Wait a second, will ya?” I said. “I'm asking you a question. Did they say what
time they'd be back, or didn't they?”
   “No, but not till very late. Daddy took the car and everything so they wouldn't
have to worry about trains. We have a radio in it now! Except that Mother said
nobody can play it when the car's in traffic.”
   I began to relax, sort of. I mean I finally quit wor rying about whether they'd
catch me home or not. I figured the hell with it. If they did, they did.
   You should've seen old Phoebe. She had on these blue pajamas with red elephants
on the collars. Elephants knock her out.
   “So it was a good picture, huh?” I said.
   “Swell, except Alice had a cold, and her mother kept asking her all the time if she
felt grippy. Right in the middle of the picture. Always in the middle of something
important, her mother'd lean all over me and everything and ask Alice if she felt
grippy. It got on my nerves.”
   Then I told her about the record. “Listen, I bought you a record,” I told her.
“Only I broke it on the way home.” I took the pieces out of my coat pocket and
showed her. “I was plastered,” I said.
   “Gimme the pieces,” she said. “I'm saving them.” She took them right out of my
hand and then she put them in the drawer of the night table. She kills me.
   “D.B. coming home for Christmas?” I asked her.
   “He may and he may not, Mother said. It all depends. He may have to stay in
Hollywood and write a picture about Annapolis.”
   “Annapolis, for God's sake!”
   “It's a love story and everything. Guess who's going to be in it! What movie star.
Guess!”
   “I'm not interested. Annapolis, for God's sake. What's D.B. know about Annap-
olis, for God's sake? What's that got to do with the kind of stories he writes?” I



said. Boy, that stuff drives me crazy. That goddam Hollywood. “What'd you do
to your arm?” I asked her. I noticed she had this big hunk of adhesive tape on her
elbow. The reason I noticed it, her pajamas didn't have any sleeves.
   “This boy, Curtis Weintraub, that's in my class, pushed me while I was going
down the stairs in the park,” she said. “Wanna see?” She started taking the crazy
adhesive tape off her arm.
   “Leave it alone. Why'd he push you down the stairs?”
   “I don't know. I think he hates me,” old Phoebe said. “This other girl and me,
Selma Atterbury, put ink and stuff all over his windbreaker.”
   “That isn't nice. What are you—a child, for God's sake?”
   “No, but every time I'm in the park, he follows me everywhere. He's always
following me. He gets on my nerves.”
   “He probably likes you. That's no reason to put ink all—”
   “I don't want him to like me,” she said. Then she started looking at me funny.
“Holden,” she said, “how come you're not home Wednesday?”
   “What?”
   Boy, you have to watch her every minute. If you don't think she's smart, you're
mad.
   “How come you're not home Wednesday?” she asked me. “You didn't get kicked
out or anything, did you?”
   “I told you. They let us out early. They let the whole—”
   “You did get kicked out! You did!” old Phoebe said. Then she hit me on the leg
with her fist. She gets very fisty when she feels like it. “You did! Oh, Hol den!” She
had her hand on her mouth and all. She gets very emotional, I swear to God.
   “Who said I got kicked out? Nobody said I—”
   “You did. You did,” she said. Then she smacked me again with her fist. If you
don't think that hurts, you're crazy. “Daddy'll kill you!” she said. Then she flopped
on her stomach on the bed and put the goddam pillow over her head. She does that
quite frequently. She's a true madman sometimes.
   “Cut it out, now,” I said. “Nobody's gonna kill me. Nobody's gonna even—
C'mon, Phoeb, take that goddam thing off your head. Nobody's gonna kill me.”
   She wouldn't take it off, though. You can't make her do something if she doesn't
want to. All she kept saying was, “Daddy s gonna kill you.” You could hardly
understand her with that goddam pillow over her head.
   “Nobody's gonna kill me. Use your head. In the first place, I'm going away. What
I may do, I may get a job on a ranch or something for a while. I know this guy
whose grandfather's got a ranch in Colorado. I may get a job out there,” I said.
“I'll keep in touch with you and all when I'm gone, if I go. C'mon. Take that off
your head. C'mon, hey, Phoeb. Please. Please, willya?”
   She wouldn t take it off, though I tried pulling it off, but she's strong as hell. You
get tired fighting with her. Boy, if she wants to keep a pillow over her head, she
keeps it. “Phoebe, please. C'mon outa there,” I kept saying. “C'mon, hey . . . Hey,
Weatherfield. C'mon out.”




 She wouldn't come out, though. You can't even reason with her sometimes.
Finally, I got up and went out in the living room and got some cigarettes out of the
box on the table and stuck some in my pocket. I was all out.


22
When I came back, she had the pillow off her head all right—I knew she would—but
she still wouldn't look at me, even though she was laying on her back and all. When
I came around the side of the bed and sat down again, she turned her crazy face
the other way. She was ostracizing the hell out of me. Just like the fencing team at
Pencey when I left all the goddam foils on the subway.
   “How's old Hazel Weatherfield?” I said. “You write any new stories about her?
I got that one you sent me right in my suitcase. It's down at the station. It's very
good.”
   “Daddy'll kill you.”
   Boy, she really gets something on her mind when she gets something on her mind.
   “No, he won't. The worst he'll do, he'll give me hell again, and then he'll send me
to that goddam military school. That's all he'll do to me. And in the first place,
I won't even be around. I'll be away. I'll be—I'll probably be in Colorado on this
ranch.”
   “Don't make me laugh. You can't even ride a horse.”
   “Who can't? Sure I can. Certainly I can. They can teach you in about two
minutes,” I said. “Stop picking at that.” She was picking at that adhesive tape on
her arm. “Who gave you that haircut?” I asked her. I just noticed what a stupid
haircut somebody gave her. It was way too short.
   “None of your business,” she said. She can be very snotty sometimes. She can
be quite snotty. “I suppose you failed in every single subject again,” she said—very
snotty. It was sort of funny, too, in a way. She sounds like a goddam schoolteacher
sometimes, and she's only a little child.
   “No, I didn't,” I said. “I passed English.” Then, just for the hell of it, I gave her
a pinch on the behind. It was sticking way out in the breeze, the way she was laying
on her side. She has hardly any behind. I didn't do it hard, but she tried to hit my
hand anyway, but she missed.
   Then all of a sudden, she said, “Oh, why did you do it?” She meant why did I
get the ax again. It made me sort of sad, the way she said it.
   “Oh, God, Phoebe, don't ask me. I'm sick of everybody asking me that,” I said.
“A million reasons why. It was one of the worst schools I ever went to. It was
full of phonies. And mean guys. You never saw so many mean guys in your life.
For instance, if you were having a bull session in somebody's room, and somebody
wanted to come in, nobody'd let them in if they were some dopey, pimply guy.
Everybody was always lock ing their door when somebody wanted to come in. And
they had this goddam secret fraternity that I was too yellow not to join. There was
this one pimply, boring guy, Robert Ackley, that wanted to get in. He kept trying




                                          97
to join, and they wouldn't let him. Just because he was boring and pimply. I don't
even feel like talking about it. It was a stinking school. Take my word.”
   Old Phoebe didn't say anything, but she was listen ing. I could tell by the back
of her neck that she was listening. She always listens when you tell her something.
And the funny part is she knows, half the time, what the hell you're talking about.
She really does.
   I kept talking about old Pencey. I sort of felt like it.
   “Even the couple of nice teachers on the faculty, they were phonies, too,” I said.
“There was this one old guy, Mr. Spencer. His wife was always giving you hot
chocolate and all that stuff, and they were really pretty nice. But you should've
seen him when the headmaster, old Thurmer, came in the history class and sat down
in the back of the room. He was always coming in and sitting down in the back of
the room for about a half an hour. He was supposed to be incognito or something.
After a while, he'd be sitting back there and then he'd start interrupting what old
Spencer was saying to crack a lot of corny jokes. Old Spencer'd practically kill
himself chuckling and smiling and all, like as if Thurmer was a goddam prince or
something.”
   “Don't swear so much.”
   “It would've made you puke, I swear it would,” I said. “Then, on Veterans' Day.
They have this day, Veterans' Day, that all the jerks that graduated from Pencey
around 1776 come back and walk all over the place, with their wives and children
and everybody. You should've seen this one old guy that was about fifty. What he
did was, he came in our room and knocked on the door and asked us if we'd mind if
he used the bathroom. The bathroom was at the end of the corridor—I don't know
why the hell he asked us. You know what he said? He said he wanted to see if his
initials were still in one of the can doors. What he did, he carved his goddam stupid
sad old initials in one of the can doors about ninety years ago, and he wanted to see
if they were still there. So my roommate and I walked him down to the bathroom
and all, and we had to stand there while he looked for his initials in all the can
doors. He kept talking to us the whole time, telling us how when he was at Pencey
they were the happiest days of his life, and giving us a lot of advice for the future
and all. Boy, did he depress me! I don't mean he was a bad guy—he wasn't. But
you don't have to be a bad guy to depress somebody—you can be a good guy and
do it. All you have to do to depress somebody is give them a lot of phony advice
while you're looking for your initials in some can door—that's all you have to do. I
don't know. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if he hadn't been all out of breath.
He was all out of breath from just climbing up the stairs, and the whole time he
was looking for his initials he kept breathing hard, with his nostrils all funny and
sad, while he kept telling Stradlater and I to get all we could out of Pencey. God,
Phoebe! I can't explain. I just didn't like anything that was happening at Pencey.
I can't explain.”
   Old Phoebe said something then, but I couldn't hear her. She had the side of her
mouth right smack on the pillow, and I couldn't hear her.




                                         98
  “What?” I said. “Take your mouth away. I can't hear you with your mouth that
way.”
   “You don't like anything that's happening.”
   It made me even more depressed when she said that.
   “Yes I do. Yes I do. Sure I do. Don't say that. Why the hell do you say that?”
   “Because you don't. You don't like any schools. You don't like a million things.
You don't.”
   “I do! That's where you're wrong—that's exactly where you're wrong! Why the
hell do you have to say that?” I said. Boy, was she depressing me.
   “Because you don't,” she said. “Name one thing.”
   “One thing? One thing I like?” I said. “Okay.”
   The trouble was, I couldn't concentrate too hot. Sometimes it's hard to concen-
trate.
   “One thing I like a lot you mean?” I asked her.
   She didn't answer me, though. She was in a cockeyed position way the hell over
the other side of the bed. She was about a thousand miles away. “C'mon answer
me,” I said. “One thing I like a lot, or one thing I just like?”
   “You like a lot.”
   “All right,” I said. But the trouble was, I couldn't concentrate. About all I could
think of were those two nuns that went around collecting dough in those beatup old
straw baskets. Especially the one with the glasses with those iron rims. And this
boy I knew at Elkton Hills. There was this one boy at Elkton Hills, named James
Castle, that wouldn't take back something he said about this very conceited boy,
Phil Stabile. James Castle called him a very conceited guy, and one of Stabile's lousy
friends went and squealed on him to Stabile. So Stabile, with about six other dirty
bastards, went down to James Castle's room and went in and locked the goddam
door and tried to make him take back what he said, but he wouldn't do it. So they
started in on him. I won't even tell you what they did to him—it's too repulsive—
but he still wouldn't take it back, old James Castle. And you should've seen him.
He was a skinny little weak-looking guy, with wrists about as big as pencils. Finally,
what he did, instead of taking back what he said, he jumped out the window. I was
in the shower and all, and even I could hear him land outside. But I just thought
something fell out the window, a radio or a desk or something, not a boy or anything.
Then I heard everybody running through the corridor and down the stairs, so I put
on my bathrobe and I ran downstairs too, and there was old James Castle laying
right on the stone steps and all. He was dead, and his teeth, and blood, were all over
the place, and nobody would even go near him. He had on this turtleneck sweater
I'd lent him. All they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel
them. They didn't even go to jail.
   That was about all I could think of, though. Those two nuns I saw at breakfast
and this boy James Castle I knew at Elkton Hills. The funny part is, I hardly even
know James Castle, if you want to know the truth. He was one of these very quiet
guys. He was in my math class, but he was way over on the other side of the room,
and he hardly ever got up to recite or go to the blackboard or anything. Some guys



                                         99
in school hardly ever get up to recite or go to the blackboard. I think the only time I
ever even had a conversation with him was that time he asked me if he could borrow
this turtleneck sweater I had. I damn near dropped dead when he asked me, I was
so surprised and all. I remember I was brushing my teeth, in the can, when he asked
me. He said his cousin was coming in to take him for a drive and all. I didn't even
know he knew I had a turtleneck sweater. All I knew about him was that his name
was always right ahead of me at roll call. Cabel, R., Cabel, W., Castle, Caulfield—I
can still remember it. If you want to know the truth, I almost didn't lend him my
sweater. Just because I didn't know him too well.
   “What?” I said to old Phoebe. She said something to me, but I didn't hear her.
   “You can't even think of one thing.”
   “Yes, I can. Yes, I can.”
   “Well, do it, then.”
   “I like Allie,” I said. “And I like doing what I'm doing right now. Sitting here
with you, and talking, and thinking about stuff, and—”
   “Allie's dead —You always say that! If somebody's dead and everything, and in
Heaven, then it isn't really—”
   “I know he's dead! Don't you think I know that? I can still like him, though,
can't I? Just because somebody's dead, you don't just stop liking them, for God's
sake—especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know
that're alive and all.”
   Old Phoebe didn't say anything. When she can't think of anything to say, she
doesn't say a goddam word.
   “Anyway, I like it now,” I said. “I mean right now. Sitting here with you and
just chewing the fat and horsing—”
   “That isn't anything real ly!”
   “It is so something real ly! Certainly it is! Why the hell isn't it? People never
think anything is anything really. I'm getting goddam sick of it,”
   “Stop swearing. All right, name something else. Name something you'd like to
be. Like a scientist. Or a lawyer or something.”
   “I couldn't be a scientist. I'm no good in science.”
   “Well, a lawyer—like Daddy and all.”
   “Lawyers are all right, I guess—but it doesn't appeal to me,” I said. “I mean
they're all right if they go around saving innocent guys' lives all the time, and like
that, but you don't do that kind of stuff if you're a lawyer. All you do is make a
lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy cars and drink Martinis and
look like a hot-shot. And besides. Even if you did go around saving guys' lives
and all, how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys'
lives, or because you did it because what you real ly wanted to do was be a terrific
lawyer, with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court
when the goddam trial was over, the reporters and everybody, the way it is in the
dirty movies? How would you know you weren't being a phony? The trouble is, you
wouldn't.”




 I'm not too sure old Phoebe knew what the hell I was talking about. I mean
she's only a little child and all. But she was listening, at least. If somebody at least
listens, it's not too bad.
   “Daddy's going to kill you. He's going to kill you,” she said.
   I wasn't listening, though. I was thinking about something else—something crazy.
“You know what I'd like to be?” I said. “You know what I'd like to be? I mean if
I had my goddam choice?”
   “What? Stop swear ing.”
   “You know that song ‘If a body catch a body comin' through the rye' ? I'd like—”
   “It's ‘If a body meet a body coming through the rye' !” old Phoebe said. “It's a
poem. By Robert Burns.”
   “I know it's a poem by Robert Burns.”
   She was right, though. It is “If a body meet a body coming through the rye.” I
didn't know it then, though.
   “I thought it was ‘If a body catch a body,' ” I said. “Anyway, I keep picturing all
these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little
kids, and nobody's around—nobody big, I mean—except me. And I'm standing on
the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they
start to go over the cliff—I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're
going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day.
I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing
I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.”
   Old Phoebe didn't say anything for a long time. Then, when she said something,
all she said was, “Daddy's going to kill you.”
   “I don't give a damn if he does,” I said. I got up from the bed then, because
what I wanted to do, I wanted to phone up this guy that was my English teacher
at Elkton Hills, Mr. Antolini. He lived in New York now. He quit Elkton Hills.
He took this job teaching English at N.Y.U. “I have to make a phone call,” I told
Phoebe. “I'll be right back. Don't go to sleep.” I didn't want her to go to sleep
while I was in the living room. I knew she wouldn't but I said it anyway, just to
make sure.
   While I was walking toward the door, old Phoebe said, “Holden!” and I turned
around.
   She was sitting way up in bed. She looked so pretty. “I'm taking belching lessons
from this girl, Phyllis Margulies,” she said. “Listen.”
   I listened, and I heard something, but it wasn't much. “Good,” I said. Then I
went out in the living room and called up this teacher I had, Mr. Antolini.


23
I made it very snappy on the phone because I was afraid my parents would barge
in on me right in the middle of it. They didn't, though. Mr. Antolini was very nice.
He said I could come right over if I wanted to. I think I probably woke he and his
wife up, because it took them a helluva long time to answer the phone. The first



                                          101
thing he asked me was if anything was wrong, and I said no. I said I'd flunked out
of Pencey, though. I thought I might as well tell him. He said “Good God,” when
I said that. He had a good sense of humor and all. He told me to come right over
if I felt like it.
   He was about the best teacher I ever had, Mr. Antolini. He was a pretty young
guy, not much older than my brother D.B., and you could kid around with him
without losing your respect for him. He was the one that finally picked up that boy
that jumped out the window I told you about, James Castle. Old Mr. Antolini felt
his pulse and all, and then he took off his coat and put it over James Castle and
carried him all the way over to the infirmary. He didn't even give a damn if his coat
got all bloody.
   When I got back to D.B.'s room, old Phoebe'd turned the radio on. This dance
music was coming out. She'd turned it on low, though, so the maid wouldn't hear
it. You should've seen her. She was sitting smack in the middle of the bed, outside
the covers, with her legs folded like one of those Yogi guys. She was listening to the
music. She kills me.
   “C'mon,” I said. “You feel like dancing?” I taught her how to dance and all when
she was a tiny little kid. She's a very good dancer. I mean I just taught her a few
things. She learned it mostly by herself. You can't teach somebody how to really
dance.
   “You have shoes on,” she said.
   “I'll take 'em off. C'mon.”
   She practically jumped off the bed, and then she waited while I took my shoes
off, and then I danced with her for a while. She's really damn good. I don't like
people that dance with little kids, because most of the time it looks terrible. I mean
if you're out at a restaurant somewhere and you see some old guy take his little kid
out on the dance floor. Usually they keep yanking the kid's dress up in the back
by mistake, and the kid can't dance worth a damn anyway, and it looks terrible,
but I don't do it out in public with Phoebe or anything. We just horse around in
the house. It's different with her anyway, because she can dance. She can follow
anything you do. I mean if you hold her in close as hell so that it doesn't matter
that your legs are so much longer. She stays right with you. You can cross over, or
do some corny dips, or even jitterbug a little, and she stays right with you. You can
even tango, for God's sake.
   We danced about four numbers. In between numbers she's funny as hell. She
stays right in position. She won't even talk or anything. You both have to stay
right in position and wait for the orchestra to start playing again. That kills me.
You're not supposed to laugh or anything, either.
   Anyway, we danced about four numbers, and then I turned off the radio. Old
Phoebe jumped back in bed and got under the covers. “I'm improving, aren't I?”
she asked me.
   “And how,” I said. I sat down next to her on the bed again. I was sort of out of
breath. I was smoking so damn much, I had hardly any wind. She wasn't even out
of breath.



 “Feel my forehead,” she said all of a sudden.
  “Why?”
  “Feel it. Just feel it once.”
  I felt it. I didn't feel anything, though.
  “Does it feel very feverish?” she said.
  “No. Is it supposed to?”
  “Yes—I'm making it. Feel it again.”
  I felt it again, and I still didn't feel anything, but I said, “I think it's starting to,
now.” I didn't want her to get a goddam inferiority complex.
  She nodded. “I can make it go up to over the thermoneter.”
  “Thermometer. Who said so?”
  “Alice Holmborg showed me how. You cross your legs and hold your breath and
think of something very, very hot. A radiator or something. Then your whole
forehead gets so hot you can burn somebody's hand.”
  That killed me. I pulled my hand away from her forehead, like I was in terrific
danger. “Thanks for tell ing me,” I said.
  “Oh, I wouldn't've burned your hand. I'd've stopped before it got too—Shhh! ”
Then, quick as hell, she sat way the hell up in bed.
  She scared hell out of me when she did that. “What's the matter?” I said.
  “The front door!” she said in this loud whisper. “It's them!”
  I quick jumped up and ran over and turned off the light over the desk. Then I
jammed out my cigarette on my shoe and put it in my pocket. Then I fanned hell
out of the air, to get the smoke out—I shouldn't even have been smoking, for God's
sake. Then I grabbed my shoes and got in the closet and shut the door. Boy, my
heart was beating like a bastard.
  I heard my mother come in the room.
  “Phoebe?” she said. “Now, stop that. I saw the light, young lady.”
  “Hello!” I heard old Phoebe say. “I couldn't sleep. Did you have a good time?”
  “Marvelous,” my mother said, but you could tell she didn't mean it. She doesn't
enjoy herself much when she goes out. “Why are you awake, may I ask? Were you
warm enough?”
  “I was warm enough, I just couldn't sleep.”
  “Phoebe, have you been smoking a cigarette in here? Tell me the truth, please,
young lady.”
  “What?” old Phoebe said.
  “You heard me.”
  “I just lit one for one second. I just took one puff. Then I threw it out the
window.”
  “Why, may I ask?”
  “I couldn't sleep.”
  “I don't like that, Phoebe. I don't like that at all,” my mother said. “Do you
want another blanket?”
  “No, thanks. G'night!” old Phoebe said. She was trying to get rid of her, you
could tell.



 “How was the movie?” my mother said.
   “Excellent. Except Alice's mother. She kept leaning over and asking her if she
felt grippy during the whole entire movie. We took a taxi home.”
   “Let me feel your forehead.”
   “I didn't catch anything. She didn't have anything. It was just her mother.”
   “Well. Go to sleep now. How was your dinner?”
   “Lousy,” Phoebe said.
   “You heard what your father said about using that word. What was lousy about
it? You had a lovely lamb chop. I walked all over Lexington Avenue just to—”
   “The lamb chop was all right, but Charlene always breathes on me whenever she
puts something down. She breathes all over the food and everything. She breathes
on everything.”
   “Well. Go to sleep. Give Mother a kiss. Did you say your prayers?”
   “I said them in the bathroom. G'night!”
   “Good night. Go right to sleep now. I have a splitting headache,” my mother
said. She gets headaches quite frequently. She really does.
   “Take a few aspirins,” old Phoebe said. “Holden'll be home on Wednesday, won't
he?”
   “So far as I know. Get under there, now. Way down.”
   I heard my mother go out and close the door. I waited a couple of minutes. Then
I came out of the closet. I bumped smack into old Phoebe when I did it, because it
was so dark and she was out of bed and coming to tell me. “I hurt you?” I said.
You had to whisper now, because they were both home. “I gotta get a move on,” I
said. I found the edge of the bed in the dark and sat down on it and started putting
on my shoes. I was pretty nervous. I admit it.
   “Don't go now,” Phoebe whispered. “Wait'll they're asleep!”
   “No. Now. Now's the best time,” I said. “She'll be in the bathroom and Daddy'll
turn on the news or something. Now's the best time.” I could hardly tie my
shoelaces, I was so damn nervous. Not that they would've killed me or anything if
they'd caught me home, but it would've been very unpleasant and all. “Where the
hell are ya?” I said to old Phoebe. It was so dark I couldn't see her.
   “Here.” She was standing right next to me. I didn't even see her.
   “I got my damn bags at the station,” I said. “Listen. You got any dough, Phoeb?
I'm practically broke.”
   “Just my Christmas dough. For presents and all. I haven't done any shopping at
all yet.”
   “Oh.” I didn't want to take her Christmas dough.
   “You want some?” she said.
   “I don't want to take your Christmas dough.”
   “I can lend you some,” she said. Then I heard her over at D.B.'s desk, opening
a million drawers and feeling around with her hand. It was pitch-black, it was so
dark in the room. “If you go away, you won't see me in the play,” she said. Her
voice sounded funny when she said it.




                                        104
  “Yes, I will. I won't go way before that. You think I wanna miss the play?” I
said. “What I'll do, I'll probably stay at Mr. Antolini's house till maybe Tuesday
night. Then I'll come home. If I get a chance, I'll phone ya.”
   “Here,” old Phoebe said. She was trying to give me the dough, but she couldn't
find my hand.
   “Where?”
   She put the dough in my hand.
   “Hey, I don't need all this,” I said. “Just give me two bucks, is all. No kidding—
Here.” I tried to give it back to her, but she wouldn't take it.
   “You can take it all. You can pay me back. Bring it to the play.”
   “How much is it, for God's sake?”
   “Eight dollars and eighty-five cents. Six ty-five cents. I spent some.”
   Then, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I couldn't help it. I did it so nobody
could hear me, but I did it. It scared hell out of old Phoebe when I started doing it,
and she came over and tried to make me stop, but once you get started, you can't
just stop on a goddam dime. I was still sitting on the edge of the bed when I did
it, and she put her old arm around my neck, and I put my arm around her, too,
but I still couldn't stop for a long time. I thought I was going to choke to death
or something. Boy, I scared hell out of poor old Phoebe. The damn window was
open and everything, and I could feel her shivering and all, because all she had on
was her pajamas. I tried to make her get back in bed, but she wouldn't go. Finally
I stopped. But it certainly took me a long, long time. Then I finished buttoning
my coat and all. I told her I'd keep in touch with her. She told me I could sleep
with her if I wanted to, but I said no, that I'd better beat it, that Mr. Antolini was
waiting for me and all. Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave
it to her. She likes those kind of crazy hats. She didn't want to take it, but I made
her. I'll bet she slept with it on. She really likes those kind of hats. Then I told her
again I'd give her a buzz if I got a chance, and then I left.
   It was a helluva lot easier getting out of the house than it was getting in, for some
reason. For one thing, I didn't give much of a damn any more if they caught me.
I really didn't. I figured if they caught me, they caught me. I almost wished they
did, in a way.
   I walked all the way downstairs, instead of taking the elevator. I went down the
back stairs. I nearly broke my neck on about ten million garbage pails, but I got
out all right. The elevator boy didn't even see me. He probably still thinks I'm up
at the Dicksteins'.


24
Mr. and Mrs. Antolini had this very swanky apartment over on Sutton Place, with
two steps that you go down to get in the living room, and a bar and all. I'd been
there quite a few times, because after I left Elkton Hills Mr. Antoilni came up
to our house for dinner quite frequently to find out how I was getting along. He
wasn't married then. Then when he got married, I used to play tennis with he



and Mrs. Antolini quite frequently, out at the West Side Tennis Club, in Forest
Hills, Long Island. Mrs. Antolini, belonged there. She was lousy with dough. She
was about sixty years older than Mr. Antolini, but they seemed to get along quite
well. For one thing, they were both very intellectual, especially Mr. Antolini except
that he was more witty than intellectual when you were with him, sort of like D.B.
Mrs. Antolini was mostly serious. She had asthma pretty bad. They both read all
D.B.'s stories—Mrs. Antolini, too—and when D.B. went to Hollywood, Mr. Antolini
phoned him up and told him not to go. He went anyway, though. Mr. Antolini said
that anybody that could write like D.B. had no business going out to Hollywood.
That's exactly what I said, practically.
   I would have walked down to their house, because I didn't want to spend any of
Phoebe's Christmas dough that I didn't have to, but I felt funny when I got outside.
Sort of dizzy. So I took a cab. I didn't want to, but I did. I had a helluva time even
find ing a cab.
   Old Mr. Antolini answered the door when I rang the bell—after the elevator boy
finally let me up, the bastard. He had on his bathrobe and slippers, and he had a
highball in one hand. He was a pretty sophisticated guy, and he was a pretty heavy
drinker. “Holden, m'boy!” he said. “My God, he's grown another twenty inches.
Fine to see you.”
   “How are you, Mr. Antolini? How's Mrs. Antolini?”
   “We're both just dandy. Let's have that coat.” He took my coat off me and hung
it up. “I expected to see a day-old infant in your arms. Nowhere to turn. Snowflakes
in your eyelashes.” He's a very witty guy sometimes. He turned around and yelled
out to the kitchen, “Lillian! How's the coffee coming?” Lillian was Mrs. Antolini's
first name.
   “It's all ready,” she yelled back. “Is that Holden? Hello, Holden!”
   “Hello, Mrs. Antolini!”
   You were always yelling when you were there. That's because the both of them
were never in the same room at the same time. It was sort of funny.
   “Sit down, Holden,” Mr. Antolini said. You could tell he was a little oiled up.
The room looked like they'd just had a party. Glasses were all over the place, and
dishes with peanuts in them. “Excuse the appearance of the place,” he said. “We've
been entertaining some Buffalo friends of Mrs. Antolini's . . . Some buffaloes, as a
matter of fact.”
   I laughed, and Mrs. Antolini yelled something in to me from the kitchen, but I
couldn't hear her. “What'd she say?” I asked Mr. Antolini.
   “She said not to look at her when she comes in. She just arose from the sack.
Have a cigarette. Are you smoking now?”
   “Thanks,” I said. I took a cigarette from the box he offered me. “Just once in a
while. I'm a moderate smoker.”
   “I'll bet you are,” he said. He gave me a light from this big lighter off the table.
“So. You and Pencey are no longer one,” he said. He always said things that way.
Sometimes it amused me a lot and sometimes it didn't. He sort of did it a little
bit too much. I don't mean he wasn't witty or anything—he was—but sometimes it



                                         106
gets on your nerves when somebody's al ways saying things like “So you and Pencey
are no longer one.” D.B. does it too much sometimes, too.
   “What was the trouble?” Mr. Antolini asked me. “How'd you do in English? I'll
show you the door in short order if you flunked English, you little ace composition
writer.”
   “Oh, I passed English all right. It was mostly literature, though. I only wrote
about two compositions the whole term,” I said. “I flunked Oral Expression, though.
They had this course you had to take, Oral Expression. That I flunked.”
   “Why?”
   “Oh, I don't know.” I didn't feel much like going into It. I was still feeling sort
of dizzy or something, and I had a helluva headache all of a sudden. I really did.
But you could tell he was interested, so I told him a little bit about it. “It's this
course where each boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech. You
know. Spontaneous and all. And if the boy digresses at all, you're supposed to yell
‘Digression!' at him as fast as you can. It just about drove me crazy. I got an F in
it.”
   “Why?”
   “Oh, I don't know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don't know.
The trouble with me is, I like it when somebody digresses. It's more interesting and
all.”
   “You don't care to have somebody stick to the point when he tells you something?”
   “Oh, sure! I like somebody to stick to the point and all. But I don't like them to
stick too much to the point. I don't know. I guess I don't like it when somebody
sticks to the point all the time. The boys that got the best marks in Oral Expression
were the ones that stuck to the point all the time—I admit it. But there was this one
boy, Richard Kinsella. He didn't stick to the point too much, and they were always
yelling ‘Digression!' at him. It was terrible, because in the first place, he was a very
nervous guy—I mean he was a very nervous guy—and his lips were always shaking
whenever it was his time to make a speech, and you could hardly hear him if you
were sitting way in the back of the room. When his lips sort of quit shaking a little
bit, though, I liked his speeches better than anybody else's. He practically flunked
the course, though, too. He got a D plus because they kept yelling ‘Digression!'
at him all the time. For instance, he made this speech about this farm his father
bought in Vermont. They kept yelling ‘Digression!' at him the whole time he was
making it, and this teacher, Mr. Vinson, gave him an F on it because he hadn't told
what kind of animals and vegetables and stuff grew on the farm and all. What he
did was, Richard Kinsella, he'd start telling you all about that stuff—then all of a
sudden he'd start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle, and
how his uncle got polio and all when he was forty-two years old, and how he wouldn't
let anybody come to see him in the hospital because he didn't want anybody to see
him with a brace on. It didn't have much to do with the farm—I admit it—but
it was nice. It's nice when somebody tells you about their uncle. Especially when
they start out telling you about their father's farm and then all of a sudden get
more interested in their uncle. I mean it's dirty to keep yelling ‘Digression!' at him



when he's all nice and excited. I don't know. It's hard to explain.” I didn't feel too
much like trying, either. For one thing, I had this terrific headache all of a sudden.
I wished to God old Mrs. Antolini would come in with the coffee. That's something
that annoys hell out of me—I mean if somebody says the coffee's all ready and it
isn't.
   “Holden . . . One short, faintly stuffy, pedagogical question. Don't you think
there's a time and place for everything? Don't you think if someone starts out to
tell you about his father's farm, he should stick to his guns, then get around to
telling you about his uncle's brace? Or, if his uncle's brace is such a provocative
subject, shouldn't he have selected it in the first place as his subject—not the farm?”
   I didn't feel much like thinking and answering and all. I had a headache and I
felt lousy. I even had sort of a stomach-ache, if you want to know the truth.
   “Yes—I don't know. I guess he should. I mean I guess he should've picked his
uncle as a subject, instead of the farm, if that interested him most. But what I mean
is, lots of time you don't know what interests you most till you start talking about
something that doesn't interest you most. I mean you can't help it sometimes. What
I think is, you're supposed to leave somebody alone if he's at least being interesting
and he's getting all excited about something. I like it when somebody gets excited
about something. It's nice. You just didn't know this teacher, Mr. Vinson. He could
drive you crazy sometimes, him and the goddam class. I mean he'd keep telling you
to unify and simplify all the time. Some things you just can't do that to. I mean
you can't hardly ever simplify and unify something just because somebody wants
you to. You didn't know this guy, Mr. Vinson. I mean he was very intelligent and
all, but you could tell he didn't have too much brains.”
   “Coffee, gentlemen, finally,” Mrs. Antolini said. She came in carrying this tray
with coffee and cakes and stuff on it. “Holden, don't you even peek at me. I'm a
mess.”
   “Hello, Mrs. Antolini,” I said. I started to get up and all, but Mr. Antolini got
hold of my jacket and pulled me back down. Old Mrs. Antolini's hair was full of
those iron curler jobs, and she didn't have any lipstick or anything on. She didn't
look too gorgeous. She looked pretty old and all.
   “I'll leave this right here. Just dive in, you two,” she said. She put the tray down
on the cigarette table, pushing all these glasses out of the way. “How's your mother,
Holden?”
   “She's fine, thanks. I haven't seen her too recently, but the last I—”
   “Darling, if Holden needs anything, everything's in the linen closet. The top shelf.
I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted,” Mrs. Antolini said. She looked it, too. “Can you
boys make up the couch by yourselves?”
   “We'll take care of everything. You run along to bed,” Mr. Antolini said. He gave
Mrs. Antolini a kiss and she said good-by to me and went in the bedroom. They
were always kissing each other a lot in public.
   I had part of a cup of coffee and about half of some cake that was as hard as
a rock. All old Mr. Antolini had was another highball, though. He makes them




                                         108
strong, too, you could tell. He may get to be an alcoholic if he doesn't watch his
step.
   “I had lunch with your dad a couple of weeks ago,” he said all of a sudden. “Did
you know that?”
   “No, I didn't.”
   “You're aware, of course, that he's terribly concerned about you.”
   “I know it. I know he is,” I said.
   “Apparently before he phoned me he'd just had a long, rather harrowing letter
from your latest headmaster, to the effect that you were making absolutely no effort
at all. Cutting classes. Coming unprepared to all your classes. In general, being an
all-around—”
   “I didn't cut any classes. You weren't allowed to cut any. There were a couple
of them I didn't attend once in a while, like that Oral Expression I told you about,
but I didn't cut any.”
   I didn't feel at all like discussing it. The coffee made my stomach feel a little
better, but I still had this awful headache.
   Mr. Antolini lit another cigarette. He smoked like a fiend. Then he said, “Frankly,
I don't know what the hell to say to you, Holden.”
   “I know. I'm very hard to talk to. I realize that.”
   “I have a feeling that you're riding for some kind of a terrible, terrible fall. But I
don't honestly know what kind . . . Are you listening to me?”
   “Yes.”
   You could tell he was trying to concentrate and all.
   “It may be the kind where, at the age of thirty, you sit in some bar hating
everybody who comes in looking as if he might have played football in college.
Then again, you may pick up just enough education to hate people who say, ‘It's
a secret between he and I.' Or you may end up in some business office, throwing
paper clips at the nearest stenographer. I just don't know. But do you know what
I'm driving at, at all?”
   “Yes. Sure,” I said. I did, too. “But you're wrong about that hating business. I
mean about hating football players and all. You really are. I don't hate too many
guys. What I may do, I may hate them for a little while, like this guy Stradlater I
knew at Pencey, and this other boy, Robert Ackley. I hated them once in a while—I
admit it—but it doesn't last too long, is what I mean. After a while, if I didn't see
them, if they didn't come in the room, or if I didn't see them in the dining room for
a couple of meals, I sort of missed them. I mean I sort of missed them.”
   Mr. Antolini didn't say anything for a while. He got up and got another hunk of
ice and put it in his drink, then he sat down again. You could tell he was thinking.
I kept wishing, though, that he'd continue the conversation in the morning, instead
of now, but he was hot. People are mostly hot to have a discussion when you're not.
   “All right. Listen to me a minute now . . . I may not word this as memorably as
I'd like to, but I'll write you a letter about it in a day or two. Then you can get
it all straight. But listen now, anyway.” He started concentrating again. Then he
said, “This fall I think you're riding for—it's a special kind of fall, a horrible kind.



                                          109
The man falling isn't permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom. He just keeps
falling and falling. The whole arrangement's designed for men who, at some time
or other in their lives, were looking for something their own environment couldn't
supply them with. Or they thought their own environment couldn't supply them
with. So they gave up looking. They gave it up before they ever really even got
started. You follow me?”
   “Yes, sir.”
   “Sure?”
   “Yes.”
   He got up and poured some more booze in his glass. Then he sat down again. He
didn't say anything for a long time.
   “I don't want to scare you,” he said, “but I can very clearly see you dying nobly,
one way or another, for some highly unworthy cause.” He gave me a funny look. “If
I write something down for you, will you read it carefully? And keep it?”
   “Yes. Sure,” I said. I did, too. I still have the paper he gave me.
   He went over to this desk on the other side of the room, and without sitting down
wrote something on a piece of paper. Then he came back and sat down with the
paper in his hand. “Oddly enough, this wasn't written by a practicing poet. It was
written by a psychoanalyst named Wilhelm Stekel. Here's what he—Are you still
with me?”
   “Yes, sure I am.”
   “Here's what he said: ‘The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die
nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly
for one.' ”
   He leaned over and handed it to me. I read it right when he gave it to me, and
then I thanked him and all and put it in my pocket. It was nice of him to go
to all that trouble. It really was. The thing was, though, I didn't feel much like
concentrating. Boy, I felt so damn tired all of a sudden.
   You could tell he wasn't tired at all, though. He was pretty oiled up, for one
thing. “I think that one of these days,” he said, “you're going to have to find out
where you want to go. And then you've got to start going there. But immediately.
You can't afford to lose a minute. Not you.”
   I nodded, because he was looking right at me and all, but I wasn't too sure what
he was talking about. I was pretty sure I knew, but I wasn't too positive at the
time. I was too damn tired.
   “And I hate to tell you,” he said, “but I think that once you have a fair idea
where you want to go, your first move will be to apply yourself in school. You'll
have to. You're a student—whether the idea appeals to you or not. You're in love
with knowledge. And I think you'll find, once you get past all the Mr. Vineses and
their Oral Comp—”
   “Mr. Vinsons,” I said. He meant all the Mr. Vinsons, not all the Mr. Vineses. I
shouldn't have interrupted him, though.
   “All right—the Mr. Vinsons. Once you get past all the Mr. Vinsons, you're going
to start getting closer and closer—that is, if you want to, and if you look for it



                                        110

aand wait for it—to the kind of information that will be very, very dear to your
heart. Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever
confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means
alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have
been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of
them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as
someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's
a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.”
He stopped and took a big drink out of his highball. Then he started again. Boy,
he was really hot. I was glad I didn't try to stop him or anything. “I'm not trying
to tell you,” he said, “that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute
something valuable to the world. It's not so. But I do say that educated and
scholarly men, if they're brilliant and creative to begin with—which, unfortunately,
is rarely the case—tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than
men do who are merely brilliant and creative. They tend to express themselves
more clearly, and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through
to the end. And—most important—nine times out of ten they have more humility
than the unscholarly thinker. Do you follow me at all?”
   “Yes, sir.”
   He didn't say anything again for quite a while. I don't know if you've ever done
it, but it's sort of hard to sit around waiting for somebody to say something when
they're thinking and all. It really is. I kept trying not to yawn. It wasn't that I was
bored or anything—I wasn't—but I was so damn sleepy all of a sudden.
   “Something else an academic education will do for you. If you go along with it
any considerable distance, it'll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have.
What it'll fit and, maybe, what it won't. After a while, you'll have an idea what
kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing. For one thing, it
may save you an extraordinary amount of time trying on ideas that don't suit you,
aren't becoming to you. You'll begin to know your true measurements and dress
your mind accordingly.”
   Then, all of a sudden, I yawned. What a rude bastard, but I couldn't help it!
   Mr. Antolini just laughed, though. “C'mon,” he said, and got up. “We'll fix up
the couch for you.”
   I followed him and he went over to this closet and tried to take down some sheets
and blankets and stuff that was on the top shelf, but he couldn't do it with this
highball glass in his hand. So he drank it and then put the glass down on the floor
and then he took the stuff down. I helped him bring it over to the couch. We both
made the bed together. He wasn't too hot at it. He didn't tuck anything in very
tight. I didn't care, though. I could've slept standing up I was so tired.
   “How're all your women?”
   “They're okay.” I was being a lousy conversationalist, but I didn't feel like it.
   “How's Sally?” He knew old Sally Hayes. I introduced him once.
   “She's all right. I had a date with her this afternoon.” Boy, it seemed like twenty
years ago! “We don't have too much in common any more.”



                                         111
 “Helluva pretty girl. What about that other girl? The one you told me about, in
Maine?”
   “Oh—Jane Gallagher. She's all right. I'm probably gonna give her a buzz tomor-
row.”
   We were all done making up the couch then. “It's all yours,” Mr. Antolini said.
“I don't know what the hell you're going to do with those legs of yours.”
   “That's all right. I'm used to short beds,” I said. “Thanks a lot, sir. You and
Mrs. Antolini really saved my life tonight.”
   “You know where the bathroom is. If there's anything you want, just holler. I'll
be in the kitchen for a while—will the light bother you?”
   “No—heck, no. Thanks a lot.”
   “All right. Good night, handsome.”
   “G'night, sir. Thanks a lot.”
   He went out in the kitchen and I went in the bathroom and got undressed and
all. I couldn't brush my teeth because I didn't have any toothbrush with me. I
didn't have any pajamas either and Mr. Antolini forgot to lend me some. So I just
went back in the living room and turned off this little lamp next to the couch, and
then I got in bed with just my shorts on. It was way too short for me, the couch,
but I really could've slept standing up without batting an eyelash. I laid awake for
just a couple of seconds thinking about all that stuff Mr. Antolini'd told me. About
finding out the size of your mind and all. He was really a pretty smart guy. But I
couldn't keep my goddam eyes open, and I fell asleep.
   Then something happened. I don't even like to talk about it.
   I woke up all of a sudden. I don't know what time it was or anything, but I woke
up. I felt something on my head, some guy's hand. Boy, it really scared hell out
of me. What it was, it was Mr. Antolini's hand. What he was doing was, he was
sitting on the floor right next to the couch, in the dark and all, and he was sort
of petting me or patting me on the goddam head. Boy, I'll bet I jumped about a
thousand feet.
   “What the hellya doing?” I said.
   “Nothing! I'm simply sitting here, admiring—”
   “What're ya doing, anyway?” I said over again. I didn't know what the hell to
say—I mean I was embarrassed as hell.
   “How 'bout keeping your voice down? I'm simply sitting here—”
   “I have to go, anyway,” I said—boy, was I nervous! I started putting on my damn
pants in the dark. I could hardly get them on I was so damn nervous. I know more
damn perverts, at schools and all, than anybody you ever met, and they're always
being perverty when I'm around.
   “You have to go where? ” Mr. Antolini said. He was trying to act very goddam
casual and cool and all, but he wasn't any too goddam cool. Take my word.
   “I left my bags and all at the station. I think maybe I'd better go down and get
them. I have all my stuff in them.”
   “They'll be there in the morning. Now, go back to bed. I'm going to bed myself.
What's the matter with you?”



                                        112

  “Nothing's the matter, it's just that all my money and stuff's in one of my bags.
I'll be right back. I'll get a cab and be right back,” I said. Boy, I was falling all over
myself in the dark. “The thing is, it isn't mine, the money. It's my mother's, and
I—”
   “Don't be ridiculous, Holden. Get back in that bed. I'm going to bed myself.
The money will be there safe and sound in the morn—”
   “No, no kidding. I gotta get going. I really do.” I was damn near all dressed
already, except that I couldn't find my tie. I couldn't remember where I'd put my
tie. I put on my jacket and all without it. Old Mr. Antolini was sitting now in
the big chair a little ways away from me, watching me. It was dark and all and
I couldn't see him so hot, but I knew he was watching me, all right. He was still
boozing, too. I could see his trusty highball glass in his hand.
   “You're a very, very strange boy.”
   “I know it,” I said. I didn't even look around much for my tie. So I went without
it. “Good-by, sir,” I said, “Thanks a lot. No kidding.”
   He kept walking right behind me when I went to the front door, and when I rang
the elevator bell he stayed in the damn doorway. All he said was that business about
my being a “very, very strange boy” again. Strange, my ass. Then he waited in
the doorway and all till the goddam elevator came. I never waited so long for an
elevator in my whole goddam life. I swear.
   I didn't know what the hell to talk about while I was waiting for the elevator,
and he kept standing there, so I said, “I'm gonna start reading some good books. I
really am.” I mean you had to say something. It was very embarrassing.
   “You grab your bags and scoot right on back here again. I'll leave the door
unlatched.”
   “Thanks a lot,” I said. “G'by!” The elevator was finally there. I got in and went
down. Boy, I was shaking like a madman. I was sweating, too. When something
perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. That kind of stuff's
happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it.


25
When I got outside, it was just getting light out. It was pretty cold, too, but it felt
good because I was sweating so much.
   I didn't know where the hell to go. I didn't want to go to another hotel and spend
all Phoebe's dough. So finally all I did was I walked over to Lexington and took
the subway down to Grand Central. My bags were there and all, and I figured I'd
sleep in that crazy waiting room where all the benches are. So that's what I did. It
wasn't too bad for a while because there weren't many people around and I could
stick my feet up. But I don't feel much like discussing it. It wasn't too nice. Don't
ever try it. I mean it. It'll depress you.
   I only slept till around nine o'clock because a million people started coming in
the waiting room and I had to take my feet down. I can't sleep so hot if I have to




                                           113

keep my feet on the floor. So I sat up. I still had that headache. It was even worse.
And I think I was more depressed than I ever was in my whole life.
   I didn't want to, but I started thinking about old Mr. Antolini and I wondered
what he'd tell Mrs. Antolini when she saw I hadn't slept there or anything. That
part didn't worry me too much, though, because I knew Mr. Antolini was very smart
and that he could make up something to tell her. He could tell her I'd gone home
or something. That part didn't worry me much. But what did worry me was the
part about how I'd woke up and found him patting me on the head and all. I mean
I wondered if just maybe I was wrong about thinking be was making a flitty pass
at ne. I wondered if maybe he just liked to pat guys on the head when they're
asleep. I mean how can you tell about that stuff for sure? You can't. I even started
wondering if maybe I should've got my bags and gone back to his house, the way
I'd said I would. I mean I started thinking that even if he was a flit he certainly'd
been very nice to me. I thought how he hadn't minded it when I'd called him up
so late, and how he'd told me to come right over if I felt like it. And how he went
to all that trouble giving me that advice about finding out the size of your mind
and all, and how he was the only guy that'd even gone near that boy James Castle
I told you about when he was dead. I thought about all that stuff. And the more
I thought about it, the more depressed I got. I mean I started thinking maybe I
should've gone back to his house. Maybe he was only patting my head just for the
hell of it. The more I thought about it, though, the more depressed and screwed
up about it I got. What made it even worse, my eyes were sore as hell. They felt
sore and burny from not getting too much sleep. Besides that, I was getting sort
of a cold, and I didn't even have a goddam handkerchief with me. I had some in
my suitcase, but I didn't feel like taking it out of that strong box and opening it up
right in public and all.
   There was this magazine that somebody'd left on the bench next to me, so I
started reading it, thinking it'd make me stop thinking about Mr. Antolini and
a million other things for at least a little while. But this damn article I started
reading made me feel almost worse. It was all about hormones. It described how
you should look, your face and eyes and all, if your hormones were in good shape,
and I didn't look that way at all. I looked exactly like the guy in the article with
lousy hormones. So I started getting worried about my hormones. Then I read this
other article about how you can tell if you have cancer or not. It said if you had any
sores in your mouth that didn't heal pretty quickly, it was a sign that you probably
had cancer. I'd had this sore on the inside of my lip for about two weeks. So figured
I was getting cancer. That magazine was some little cheerer upper. I finally quit
reading it and went outside for a walk. I figured I'd be dead in a couple of months
because I had cancer. I really did. I was even positive I would be. It certainly didn't
make me feel too gorgeous. It'sort of looked like it was going to rain, but I went for
this walk anyway. For one thing, I figured I ought to get some breakfast. I wasn't
at all hungry, but I figured I ought to at least eat something. I mean at least get
something with some vitamins in it. So I started walking way over east, where the
pretty cheap restaurants are, because I didn't want to spend a lot of dough.



                                         114

 While I was walking, I passed these two guys that were unloading this big Christ-
mas tree off a truck. One guy kept saying to the other guy, “Hold the sonuvabitch
up! Hold it up, for Chrissake!” It certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a
Christmas tree. It was sort of funny, though, in an awful way, and I started to sort
of laugh. It was about the worst thing I could've done, because the minute I started
to laugh I thought I was going to vomit. I really did. I even started to, but it went
away. I don't know why. I mean I hadn't eaten anything unsanitary or like that
and usually I have quite a strong stomach. Anyway, I got over it, and I figured I'd
feel better if I had something to eat. So I went in this very cheap-looking restaurant
and had doughnuts and coffee. Only, I didn't eat the doughnuts. I couldn't swallow
them too well. The thing is, if you get very depressed about something, it's hard
as hell to swallow. The waiter was very nice, though. He took them back without
charging me. I just drank the coffee. Then I left and started walking over toward
Fifth Avenue.
   It was Monday and all, and pretty near Christmas, and all the stores were open.
So it wasn't too bad walking on Fifth Avenue. It was fairly Christmasy. All those
scraggy-looking Santa Clauses were standing on corners ringing those bells, and the
Salvation Army girls, the ones that don't wear any lipstick or anything, were tinging
bells too. I sort of kept looking around for those two nuns I'd met at breakfast the
day before, but I didn't see them. I knew I wouldn't, because they'd told me they'd
come to New York to be schoolteachers, but I kept looking for them anyway. Anyway,
it was pretty Christmasy all of a sudden. A million little kids were downtown with
their mothers, getting on and off buses and coming in and out of stores. I wished
old Phoebe was around. She's not little enough any more to go stark staring mad in
the toy department, but she enjoys horsing around and looking at the people. The
Christmas before last I took her downtown shopping with me. We had a helluva
time. I think it was in Bloomingdale's. We went in the shoe department and we
pretended she—old Phoebe— wanted to get a pair of those very high storm shoes,
the kind that have about a million holes to lace up. We had the poor salesman guy
going crazy. Old Phoebe tried on about twenty pairs, and each time the poor guy
had to lace one shoe all the way up. It was a dirty trick, but it killed old Phoebe.
We finally bought a pair of moccasins and charged them. The salesman was very
nice about it. I think he knew we were horsing around, because old Phoebe always
starts giggling.
   Anyway, I kept walking and walking up Fifth Avenue, without any tie on or
anything. Then all of a sudden, something very spooky started happening. Every
time I came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb, I had this feeling
that I'd never get to the other side of the street. I thought I'd just go down, down,
down, and nobody'd ever see me again. Boy, did it scare me. You can't imagine.
I started sweating like a bastard—my whole shirt and underwear and everything.
Then I started doing something else. Every time I'd get to the end of a block I'd
make believe I was talking to my brother Allie. I'd say to him, “Allie, don't let
me disappear. Allie, don't let me disappear. Allie, don't let me disappear. Please,
Allie.” And then when I'd reach the other side of the street without disappearing,



                                         115

I'd thank him. Then it would start all over again as soon as I got to the next corner.
But I kept going and all. I was sort of afraid to stop, I think—I don't remember,
to tell you the truth. I know I didn't stop till I was way up in the Sixties, past the
zoo and all. Then I sat down on this bench. I could hardly get my breath, and I
was still sweating like a bastard. I sat there, I guess, for about an hour. Finally,
what I decided I'd do, I decided I'd go away. I decided I'd never go home again
and I'd never go away to another school again. I decided I'd just see old Phoebe
and sort of say good-by to her and all, and give her back her Christmas dough, and
then I'd start hitchhiking my way out West. What I'd do, I figured, I'd go down
to the Holland Tunnel and bum a ride, and then I'd bum another one, and another
one, and another one, and in a few days I'd be somewhere out West where it was
very pretty and sunny and where nobody'd know me and I'd get a job. I figured
I could get a job at a filling station somewhere, putting gas and oil in people's
cars. I didn't care what kind of job it was, though. Just so people didn't know
me and I didn't know anybody. I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one
of those deaf-mutes. That way I wouldn't have to have any goddam stupid useless
conversations with anybody. If anybody wanted to tell me something, they'd have
to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me. They'd get bored as hell
doing that after a while, and then I'd be through with having conversations for the
rest of my life. Everybody'd think I was just a poor deaf-mute bastard and they'd
leave me alone. They'd let me put gas and oil in their stupid cars, and they'd pay
me a salary and all for it, and I'd build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough
I made and live there for the rest of my life. I'd build it right near the woods, but
not right in them, because I'd want it to be sunny as hell all the time. I'd cook all
my own food, and later on, if I wanted to get married or something, I'd meet this
beautiful girl that was also a deaf-mute and we'd get married. She'd come and live
in my cabin with me, and if she wanted to say anything to me, she'd have to write
it on a goddam piece of paper, like everybody else. If we had any children, we'd
hide them somewhere. We could buy them a lot of books and teach them how to
read and write by ourselves.
   I got excited as hell thinking about it. I really did. I knew the part about
pretending I was a deaf-mute was crazy, but I liked thinking about it anyway. But
I really decided to go out West and all. All I wanted to do first was say good-by to
old Phoebe. So all of a sudden, I ran like a madman across the street—I damn near
got killed doing it, if you want to know the truth—and went in this stationery store
and bought a pad and pencil. I figured I'd write her a note telling her where to meet
me so I could say good-by to her and give her back her Christmas dough, and then
I'd take the note up to her school and get somebody in the principal's office to give
it to her. But I just put the pad and pencil in my pocket and started walking fast
as hell up to her school—I was too excited to write the note right in the stationery
store. I walked fast because I wanted her to get the note before she went home for
lunch, and I didn't have any too much time.
   I knew where her school was, naturally, because I went there myself when I was
a kid. When I got there, it felt funny. I wasn't sure I'd remember what it was like



                                         116
inside, but I did. It was exactly the same as it was when I went there. They had
that same big yard inside, that was always sort of dark, with those cages around
the light bulbs so they wouldn't break if they got hit with a ball. They had those
same white circles painted all over the floor, for games and stuff. And those same
old basketball rings without any nets—just the backboards and the rings.
   Nobody was around at all, probably because it wasn't recess period, and it wasn't
lunchtime yet. All I saw was one little kid, a colored kid, on his way to the bathroom.
He had one of those wooden passes sticking out of his hip pocket, the same way we
used to have, to show he had permission and all to go to the bathroom.
   I was still sweating, but not so bad any more. I went over to the stairs and sat
down on the first step and took out the pad and pencil I'd bought. The stairs had
the same smell they used to have when I went there. Like somebody'd just taken a
leak on them. School stairs always smell like that. Anyway, I sat there and wrote
this note:

     Dear Phoebe,
       I can't wait around till Wednesday any more so I will probably hitch
     hike out west this afternoon. Meet me at the Museum of art near the
     door at quarter past 12 if you can and I will give you your Christmas
     dough back. I didn't spend much.
                                              Love,
                                                 Holden

   Her school was practically right near the museum, and she had to pass it on her
way home for lunch anyway, so I knew she could meet me all right.
   Then I started walking up the stairs to the principal's office so I could give the
note to somebody that would bring it to her in her classroom. I folded it about
ten times so nobody'd open it. You can't trust anybody in a goddam school. But I
knew they'd give it to her if I was her brother and all.
   While I was walking up the stairs, though, all of a sudden I thought I was going
to puke again. Only, I didn't. I sat down for a second, and then I felt better. But
while I was sitting down, I saw something that drove me crazy. Somebody'd written
“Fuck you” on the wall. It drove me damn near crazy. I thought how Phoebe and
all the other little kids would see it, and how they'd wonder what the hell it meant,
and then finally some dirty kid would tell them—all cockeyed, naturally—what it
meant, and how they'd all think about it and maybe even wor ry about it for a
couple of days. I kept wanting to kill whoever'd written it. I figured it was some
perverty bum that'd sneaked in the school late at night to take a leak or something
and then wrote it on the wall. I kept picturing myself catching him at it, and how
I'd smash his head on the stone steps till he was good and goddam dead and bloody.
But I knew, too, I wouldn't have the guts to do it. I knew that. That made me even
more depressed. I hardly even had the guts to rub it off the wall with my hand, if
you want to know the truth. I was afraid some teacher would catch me rubbing it
off and would think I'd written it. But I rubbed it out anyway, finally. Then I went
on up to the principal's office.



                                         117

 The principal didn't seem to be around, but some old lady around a hundred
years old was sitting at a typewriter. I told her I was Phoebe Caulfield's brother, in
4B-1, and I asked her to please give Phoebe the note. I said it was very important
because my mother was sick and wouldn't have lunch ready for Phoebe and that
she'd have to meet me and have lunch in a drugstore. She was very nice about it,
the old lady. She took the note off me and called some other lady, from the next
office, and the other lady went to give it to Phoebe. Then the old lady that was
around a hundred years old and I shot the breeze for a while, She was pretty nice,
and I told her how I'd gone there to school, too, and my brothers. She asked me
where I went to school now, and I told her Pencey, and she said Pencey was a very
good school. Even if I'd wanted to, I wouldn't have had the strength to straighten
her out. Besides, if she thought Pencey was a very good school, let her think it. You
hate to tell new stuff to somebody around a hundred years old. They don't like to
hear it. Then, after a while, I left. It was funny. She yelled “Good luck!” at me the
same way old Spencer did when I left Pencey. God, how I hate it when somebody
yells “Good luck!” at me when I'm leaving somewhere. It's depressing.
   I went down by a different staircase, and I saw another “Fuck you” on the wall. I
tried to rub it off with my hand again, but this one was scratched on, with a knife or
something. It wouldn't come off. It's hopeless, anyway. If you had a million years
to do it in, you couldn't rub out even half the “Fuck you” signs in the world. It's
impossible.
   I looked at the clock in the recess yard, and it was only twenty to twelve, so I had
quite a lot of time to kill before I met old Phoebe. But I just walked over to the
museum anyway. There wasn't anyplace else to go. I thought maybe I might stop
in a phone booth and give old Jane Gallagher a buzz before I started bumming my
way west, but I wasn't in the mood. For one thing, I wasn't even sure she was home
for vacation yet. So I just went over to the museum, and hung around.
   While I was waiting around for Phoebe in the museum, right inside the doors and
all, these two little kids came up to me and asked me if I knew where the mummies
were. The one little kid, the one that asked me, had his pants open. I told him about
it. So he buttoned them up right where he was standing talking to me—he didn't
even bother to go behind a post or anything. He killed me. I would've laughed,
but I was afraid I'd feel like vomiting again, so I didn't. “Where're the mummies,
fella?” the kid said again. “Ya know?”
   I horsed around with the two of them a little bit. “The mummies? What're
they?” I asked the one kid.
   “You know. The mummies—them dead guys. That get buried in them toons and
all.”
   Toons. That killed me. He meant tombs.
   “How come you two guys aren't in school?” I said.
   “No school t'day,” the kid that did all the talking said. He was lying, sure as
I'm alive, the little bastard. I didn't have anything to do, though, till old Phoebe
showed up, so I helped them find the place where the mummies were. Boy, I used
to know exactly where they were, but I hadn't been in that museum in years.



                                         118
  “You two guys so interested in mummies?” I said.
   “Yeah.”
   “Can't your friend talk?” I said.
   “He ain't my friend. He's my brudda.”
   “Can't he talk?” I looked at the one that wasn't doing any talking. “Can't you
talk at all?” I asked him.
   “Yeah,” he said. “I don't feel like it.”
   Finally we found the place where the mummies were, and we went in.
   “You know how the Egyptians buried their dead?” I asked the one kid.
   “Naa.”
   “Well, you should. It's very interesting. They wrapped their faces up in these
cloths that were treated with some secret chemical. That way they could be buried in
their tombs for thousands of years and their faces wouldn't rot or anything. Nobody
knows how to do it except the Egyptians. Even modern science.”
   To get to where the mummies were, you had to go down this very narrow sort of
hall with stones on the side that they'd taken right out of this Pharaoh's tomb and
all. It was pretty spooky, and you could tell the two hot-shots I was with weren't
enjoying it too much. They stuck close as hell to me, and the one that didn't talk
at all practically was holding onto my sleeve. “Let's go,” he said to his brother. “I
seen 'em awreddy. C'mon, hey.” He turned around and beat it.
   “He's got a yella streak a mile wide,” the other one said. “So long!” He beat it
too.
   I was the only one left in the tomb then. I sort of liked it, in a way. It was so
nice and peaceful. Then, all of a sudden, you'd never guess what I saw on the wall.
Another “Fuck you.” It was written with a red crayon or something, right under
the glass part of the wall, under the stones.
   That's the whole trouble. You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful,
because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're
not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write “Fuck you” right under your nose. Try
it sometime. I think, even, if I ever die, and they stick me in a cemetery, and I
have a tombstone and all, it'll say “Holden Caulfield” on it, and then what year I
was born and what year I died, and then right under that it'll say “Fuck you.” I'm
positive, in fact.
   After I came out of the place where the mummies were, I had to go to the bath-
room. I sort of had diarrhea, if you want to know the truth. I didn't mind the
diarrhea part too much, but something else happened. When I was coming out of
the can, right before I got to the door, I sort of passed out. I was lucky, though. I
mean I could've killed myself when I hit the floor, but all I did was sort of land on
my side. it was a funny thing, though. I felt better after I passed out. I really did.
My arm sort of hurt, from where I fell, but I didn't feel so damn dizzy any more.
   It was about ten after twelve or so then, and so I went back and stood by the
door and waited for old Phoebe. I thought how it might be the last time I'd ever see
her again. Any of my relatives, I mean. I figured I'd probably see them again, but
not for years. I might come home when I was about thirty-five. I figured, in case



                                         119

somebody got sick and wanted to see me before they died, but that would be the
only reason I'd leave my cabin and come back. I even started picturing how it would
be when I came back. I knew my mother'd get nervous as hell and start to cry and
beg me to stay home and not go back to my cabin, but I'd go anyway. I'd be casual
as hell. I'd make her calm down, and then I'd go over to the other side of the living
room and take out this cigarette case and light a cigarette, cool as all hell. I'd ask
them all to visit me sometime if they wanted to, but I wouldn't insist or anything.
What I'd do, I'd let old Phoebe come out and visit me in the summertime and on
Christmas vacation and Easter vacation. And I'd let D.B. come out and visit me
for a while if he wanted a nice, quiet place for his writing, but he couldn't write any
movies in my cabin, only stories and books. I'd have this rule that nobody could do
anything phony when they visited me. If anybody tried to do anything phony, they
couldn't stay.
   All of a sudden I looked at the clock in the checkroom and it was twenty-five of
one. I began to get scared that maybe that old lady in the school had told that other
lady not to give old Phoebe my message. I began to get scared that maybe she'd
told her to burn it or something. It really scared hell out of me. I really wanted to
see old Phoebe before I hit the road. I mean I had her Christmas dough and all.
   Finally, I saw her. I saw her through the glass part of the door. The reason I saw
her, she had my crazy hunting hat on—you could see that hat about ten miles away.
   I went out the doors and started down these stone stairs to meet her. The thing I
couldn't understand, she had this big suitcase with her. She was just coming across
Fifth Avenue, and she was dragging this goddam big suitcase with her. She could
hardly drag it. When I got up closer, I saw it was my old suitcase, the one I used
to use when I was at Whooton. I couldn't figure out what the hell she was doing
with it. “Hi,” she said when she got up close. She was all out of breath from that
crazy suitcase.
   “I thought maybe you weren't coming,” I said. “What the hell's in that bag? I
don't need anything. I'm just going the way I am. I'm not even taking the bags I
got at the station. What the hellya got in there?”
   She put the suitcase down. “My clothes,” she said. “I'm going with you. Can I?
Okay?”
   “What?” I said. I almost fell over when she said that. I swear to God I did. I
got sort of dizzy and I thought I was going to pass out or something again.
   “I took them down the back elevator so Charlene wouldn't see me. It isn't heavy.
All I have in it is two dresses and my moccasins and my underwear and socks and
some other things. Feel it. It isn't heavy. Feel it once . . . Can't I go with you?
Holden? Can't I? Please.”
   “No. Shut up.”
   I thought I was going to pass out cold. I mean I didn't mean to tell her to shut
up and all, but I thought I was going to pass out again.
   “Why can't I? Please, Holden! I won't do anything— I'll just go with you, that's
all! I won't even take my clothes with me if you don't want me to—I'll just take
my—”



                                         120

  “You can't take anything. Because you're not going. I'm going alone. So shut
up.”
   “Please, Holden. Please let me go. I'll be very, very, very—You won't even—”
   “You're not going. Now, shut up! Gimme that bag,” I said. I took the bag off
her. I was almost all set to hit her, I thought I was going to smack her for a second.
I really did.
   She started to cry.
   “I thought you were supposed to be in a play at school and all I thought you were
supposed to be Benedict Arnold in that play and all,” I said. I said it very nasty.
“Whuddaya want to do? Not be in the play, for God's sake?” That made her cry
even harder. I was glad. All of a sudden I wanted her to cry till her eyes practically
dropped out. I almost hated her. I think I hated her most because she wouldn't be
in that play any more if she went away with me.
   “Come on,” I said. I started up the steps to the museum again. I figured what
I'd do was, I'd check the crazy suitcase she'd brought in the checkroom, andy then
she could get it again at three o'clock, after school. I knew she couldn't take it back
to school with her. “Come on, now,” I said.
   She didn't go up the steps with me, though. She wouldn't come with me. I went
up anyway, though, and brought the bag in the checkroom and checked it, and then
I came down again. She was still standing there on the sidewalk, but she turned
her back on me when I came up to her. She can do that. She can turn her back on
you when she feels like it. “I'm not going away anywhere. I changed my mind. So
stop crying, and shut up,” I said. The funny part was, she wasn't even crying when
I said that. I said it anyway, though, “C'mon, now. I'll walk you back to school.
C'mon, now. You'll be late.”
   She wouldn't answer me or anything. I sort of tried to get hold of her old hand,
but she wouldn't let me. She kept turning around on me.
   “Didja have your lunch? Ya had your lunch yet?” I asked her.
   She wouldn't answer me. All she did was, she took off my red hunting hat—the
one I gave her—and practically chucked it right in my face. Then she turned her
back on me again. It nearly killed me, but I didn't say anything. I just picked it up
and stuck it in my coat pocket.
   “Come on, hey. I'll walk you back to school,” I said.
   “I'm not going back to school.”
   I didn't know what to say when she said that. I just stood there for a couple of
minutes.
   “You have to go back to school. You want to be in that play, don't you? You
want to be Benedict Arnold, don't you?”
   “No.”
   “Sure you do. Certainly you do. C'mon, now, let's go,” I said. “In the first place,
I'm not going away anywhere, I told you. I'm going home. I'm going home as soon
as you go back to school. First I'm gonna go down to the station and get my bags,
and then I'm gonna go straight—”




                                         121
  “I said I'm not going back to school. You can do what you want to do, but I'm
not going back to chool,” she said. “So shut up.” It was the first time she ever told
me to shut up. It sounded terrible. God, it sounded terrible. It sounded worse than
swearing. She still wouldn't look at me either, and every time I sort of put my hand
on her shoulder or something, she wouldn't let me.
   “Listen, do you want to go for a walk?” I asked her. “Do you want to take a walk
down to the zoo? If I let you not go back to school this afternoon and go for walk,
will you cut out this crazy stuff?”
   She wouldn't answer me, so I said it over again. “If I let you skip school this
afternoon and go for a little walk, will you cut out the crazy stuff? Will you go back
to school tomorrow like a good girl?”
   “I may and I may not,” she said. Then she ran right the hell across the street,
without even looking to see if any cars were coming. She's a madman sometimes.
   I didn't follow her, though. I knew she'd follow me, so I started walking downtown
toward the zoo, on the park side of the street, and she started walking downtown
on the other goddam side of the street, She wouldn't look over at me at all, but I
could tell she was probably watching me out of the corner of her crazy eye to see
where I was going and all. Anyway, we kept walking that way all the way to the
zoo. The only thing that bothered me was when a double-decker bus came along
because then I couldn't see across the street and I couldn't see where the hell she
was. But when we got to the zoo, I yelled over to her, “Phoebe! I'm going in the
zoo! C'mon, now!” She wouldn't look at me, but I could tell she heard me, and
when I started down the steps to the zoo I turned around and saw she was crossing
the street and following me and all.
   There weren't too many people in the zoo because it was sort of a lousy day, but
there were a few around the sea lions' swimming pool and all. I started to go by
but old Phoebe stopped and made out she was watching the sea lions getting fed—a
guy was throwing fish at them—so I went back. I figured it was a good chance to
catch up with her and all. I went up and sort of stood behind her and sort of put
my hands on her shoulders, but she bent her knees and slid out from me—she can
certainly be very snotty when she wants to. She kept standing there while the sea
lions were getting fed and I stood right behind her. I didn't put my hands on her
shoulders again or anything because if I had she really would've beat it on me. Kids
are funny. You have to watch what you're doing.
   She wouldn't walk right next to me when we left the sea lions, but she didn't walk
too far away. She sort of walked on one side of the sidewalk and I walked on the
other side. It wasn't too gorgeous, but it was better than having her walk about a
mile away from me, like before. We went up and watched the bears, on that little
hill, for a while, but there wasn't much to watch. Only one of the bears was out,
the polar bear. The other one, the brown one, was in his goddam cave and wouldn't
come out. All you could see was his rear end. There was a little kid standing next
to me, with a cowboy hat on practically over his ears, and he kept telling his father,
“Make him come out, Daddy. Make him come out.” I looked at old Phoebe, but




                                         122
she wouldn't laugh. You know kids when they're sore at you. They won't laugh or
anything.
   After we left the bears, we left the zoo and crossed over this little street in the
park, and then we went through one of those little tunnels that always smell from
somebody's taking a leak. It was on the way to the carrousel. Old Phoebe still
wouldn't talk to me or anything, but she was sort of walking next to me now. I took
a hold of the belt at the back of her coat, just for the hell of it, but she wouldn't
let me. She said, “Keep your hands to yourself, if you don't mind.” She was still
sore at me. But not as sore as she was before. Anyway, we kept getting closer and
closer to the carrousel and you could start to hear that nutty music it always plays.
It was playing “Oh, Marie!” It played that same song about fifty years ago when I
was a little kid. That's one nice thing about carrousels, they always play the same
songs.
   “I thought the carrousel was closed in the wintertime,” old Phoebe said. It was
the first time she practically said anything. She probably forgot she was supposed
to be sore at me.
   “Maybe because it's around Christmas,” I said.
   She didn't say anything when I said that. She probably remembered she was
supposed to be sore at me.
   “Do you want to go for a ride on it?” I said. I knew she probably did. When she
was a tiny little kid, and Allie and D.B. and I used to go to the park with her, she
was mad about the carrousel. You couldn't get her off the goddam thing.
   “I'm too big.” she said. I thought she wasn't going to answer me, but she did.
   “No, you're not. Go on. I'll wait for ya. Go on,” I said. We were right there then.
There were a few kids riding on it, mostly very little kids, and a few parents were
waiting around outside, sitting on the benches and all. What I did was, I went up to
the window where they sell the tickets and bought old Phoebe a ticket. Then I gave
it to her. She was standing right next to me. “Here,” I said. “Wait a second—take
the rest of your dough, too.” I started giving her the rest of the dough she'd lent
me.
   “You keep it. Keep it for me,” she said. Then she said right afterward—“Please.”
   That's depressing, when somebody says “please” to you. I mean if it's Phoebe
or somebody. That depressed the hell out of me. But I put the dough back in my
pocket.
   “Aren't you gonna ride, too?” she asked me. She was looking at me sort of funny.
You could tell she wasn't too sore at me any more.
   “Maybe I will the next time. I'll watch ya,” I said. “Got your ticket?”
   “Yes.”
   “Go ahead, then—I'll be on this bench right over here. I'll watch ya.” I went over
and sat down on this bench, and she went and got on the carrousel. She walked all
around it. I mean she walked once all the way around it. Then she sat down on this
big, brown, beat-up-looking old horse. Then the carrousel started, and I watched
her go around and around. There were only about five or six other kids on the ride,
and the song the carrousel was playing was “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.” It was



                                         123
playing it very jazzy and funny. All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring,
and so was old Phoebe, and I was sort of afraid she'd fall off the goddam horse, but
I didn't say anything or do anything. The thing with kids is, if they want to grab
the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off they
fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them.
   When the ride was over she got off her horse and came over to me. “You ride
once, too, this time,” she said.
   “No, I'll just watch ya. I think I'll just watch,” I said. I gave her some more of
her dough. “Here. Get some more tickets.”
   She took the dough off me. “I'm not mad at you any more,” she said.
   “I know. Hurry up—the thing's gonna start again.”
   Then all of a sudden she gave me a kiss. Then she held her hand out, and said,
“It's raining. It's starting to rain.”
   “I know.”
   Then what she did—it damn near killed me—she reached in my coat pocket and
took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head.
   “Don't you want it?” I said.
   “You can wear it a while.”
   “Okay. Hurry up, though, now. You're gonna miss your ride. You won't get your
own horse or anything.”
   She kept hanging around, though.
   “Did you mean it what you said? You really aren't going away anywhere? Are
you really going home afterwards?” she asked me.
   “Yeah,” I said. I meant it, too. I wasn't lying to her. I really did go home
afterwards. “Hurry up, now,” I said. “The thing's starting.”
   She ran and bought her ticket and got back on the goddam carrousel just in time.
Then she walked all the way around it till she got her own horse back. Then she
got on it. She waved to me and I waved back.
   Boy, it began to rain like a bastard. In buckets, I swear to God. All the parents and
mothers and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel, so
they wouldn't get soaked to the skin or anything, but I stuck around on the bench
for quite a while. I got pretty soaking wet, especially my neck and my pants. My
hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection, in a way; but I got soaked
anyway. I didn't care, though. I felt so damn happy all of sudden, the way old
Phoebe kept going around and around. I was damn near bawling, I felt so damn
happy, if you want to know the truth. I don't know why. It was just that she looked
so damn nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all.
God, I wish you could've been there.


26
That's all I'm going to tell about. I could probably tell you what I did after I went
home, and how I got sick and all, and what school I'm supposed to go to next fall,




                                          124
after I get out of here, but I don't feel like it. I really don't. That stuff doesn't
interest me too much right now.
   A lot of people, especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here, keeps asking
me if I'm going apply myself when I go back to school next September. It's such a
stupid question, in my opinion. I mean how do you know what you're going to do
till you do it? The answer is, you don't. I think I am, but how do I know? I swear
it's a stupid question.
   D.B. isn't as bad as the rest of them, but he keeps asking me a lot of questions,
too. He drove over last Saturday with this English babe that's in this new picture
he's writing. She was pretty affected, but very good-looking. Anyway, one time
when she went to the ladies' room way the hell down in the other wing D.B. asked
me what I thought about all this stuff I just finished telling you about. I didn't
know what the hell to say. If you want to know the truth, I don't know what I think
about it. I'm sorry I told so many people about it. About all I know is, I sort of
miss everybody I told about. Even old Stradlater and Ackley, for instance. I think
I even miss that goddam Maurice. It's funny. Don't ever tell anybody anything. If
you do, you start missing everybody.

          EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

          As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
          SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
          BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
          by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

          The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
          BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
          recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
          Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
          The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

          One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
          iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
          cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
          has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

          As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
          and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
          sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
          step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
          skin off ankles.

          AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
          Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
          time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
          painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
          from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
          Greenville Auction.

                         DJANGO
          Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
          cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

          He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
          he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
          hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
          unknown, never to be seen again.

          As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

          DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
          with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
          for forty.

          WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
          down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
          circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
          structure.

          The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
          of the auction block.









                         2

                         DJANGO
          is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
          (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
          the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
          the block.
          A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
          of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

                         DJANGO
          takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
          folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

          It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
          as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
          the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
          buy Niggers, who look up to him.
          His heart fills with poison.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
          blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.

          THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
          end.


          /--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

          It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
          their black skinned cargo forward.
          It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
          create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
          to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
          their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
          It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
          two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
          seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
          all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
          resemble a human locomotive.
          The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
          Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
          fur collars.

          WHEN...
          .A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
          makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
          rifles for possible trouble.









                         3

          A BLACK HORSE
          carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
          foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

                         THE RIDER
          appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
          winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
          hat on his head.

                         DICKY SPECK
          Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
          State your business, or prepare to get
          winged!

                         THE RIDER
          Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
          harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
          The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
          of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
          face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

                         THE RIDER
          (to the Slavers)
          Good cold evening gentlemen.
          (to the shivering Slaves)
          Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
          slave traders that go by the'name of
          The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

                         ACE SPECK
          Who wants to. know?

                         THE RIDER
          I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
          is my horse, Fritz.
          Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
          him.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You a doctor?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Affirmative.

                         DICKY SPECK
          What kinda doctor?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
          purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

                         ACE SPECK
          So what?









                         LE
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So, I wish to parley with you.

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
          second language. Amongst your inventory,
          I've been led to believe, is a specimen
          I'm keen to acquire.
          (to the slaves)
          Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
          you, who was formerly a resident of
          The Carrucan Plantation?
          Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
          half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
          VOICE rings out;

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
          Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
          lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

                         DJANGO
          Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
          for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
          amazing name - during your time at the
          Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
          three overseers by the name of The Brittle
          Brothers?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz is delighted.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

                         DJANGO
          Dem da Brittle Brothers.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So Django, do you think you could recognize -
          ???. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
          Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.









                         ACE SPECK
          Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like what?

                         ACE SPEC
          Like that!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English, goddamit!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
          trying to conduct a transaction.

                         ACE SPECK
          I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
          sale.
          Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

                         ACE SPECK
          Move it!
          Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good man, did you simply get carried away
          with your dramatic gesture, or are you
          pointing that weapon at me with lethal
          intention...?

                         ACE SPECK
          Last chance, fancy pants
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          - Very well -
           The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
          darkness.
          The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
          holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
          .BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.








          Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
          direction...

          BAM...
          Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
          .The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
          When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
          hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
          Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
          The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
          white man before.
          Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
          Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
          pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
          But I didn't want you to do anything rash
          before you had a moment to come to your senses.
          Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
          Dicky's body.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          I only shot your brother, once he threatened
          to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

                         (COUNTING OUT

                         THE SLAVES)
          .one, two, three, four, five, six,
          seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

                         DICKY SPECK
          My damn legs busted!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
          caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
          to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          As I was saying, if you were to see
          the Brittle Brothers again, would you
          recognize them?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.








          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
          look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
          unshaven white men, can you honestly
          and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

          DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
          outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
          letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
          are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
          front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
          shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
          As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
          white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
          her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
          faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
          Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
          and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

          BACK TO DJANGO

                         DJANGO
          I can point 'em out.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
          Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          I'm gonna lose this leg!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, unless you find a talented physician
          very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
          end result. But back to business, how much
          do you want for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          You go to hell!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Don't be silly. How much for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          800 dollars!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
          the slave trade that you and your family does,
          but neither was I born yesterday.









                         8
          The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
          that the going rate for African flesh'
          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
          Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
          why would they lie - puts his price at
          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
          young Django here.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
          one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And since your late brother. won't be using
          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
          He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
          Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
          on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
          finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
          Django is free.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
          rubbing, then get up on that horse.
          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
          Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
          over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
          Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
          bill of sale. Do you have one?
          Dicky just curses him.
          He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
          (as he writes)
          This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
          (he stops, then
          says to Django)
          Django is spelled with a silent "D",
          is it not?









                         9

                         DJANGO
          Huh?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not..
          He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
          way it looks.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that does add a little character.
          The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
          under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
          mark here.
          The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
          wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
          And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
          He signs the bill of sale.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
          pleasure doing business with you, but your
          customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
          The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
          leg irons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now as to you poor devils.
          He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
          of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
          choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
          beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
          to the nearest town. Which would be at least
          thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
          Or ...
          .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
          rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
          bury the two of them deep, and make your way
          to a more enlightened area of the country.
          The choice is yours.
          He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;









                         0
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, and on the off chance that there's
          any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
          the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
          He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Just give him a little kick.
          Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          See, it's not so difficult.

          EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
          The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
          silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
          Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
          shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
          Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

                         DJANGO
          Who?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Your horse?

                         DJANGO
          What horse?
          Dr.SCHULTZ'
          The horse you're riding.

                         DJANGO
          This ain't my horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is.

                         DJANGO
          No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
          it.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
          technically not. If it's my horse, I can
          give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
          Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
          congratulations.









                         /1

                         DJANGO
          I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
          up in no stable.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          Don't worry about all that!
          They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
          then says with a smile;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
          intend to name it? Half the fun of having
          a horse is choosing his name. For instance
          my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
          ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
          couldn't do without him.
          (he pats Fritz's neck)
          Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
          something one does lightly. So once you've
          thought about it for awhile -

                         DJANGO
          - Tony.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          - Tony what?

                         DJANGO
          - I dunno, Tony the horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
          Tony?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
          Why Tony?

                         DJANGO
          I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
          tell ya.
          As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
          western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

                         TEXAS"









                         /Z
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
          there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
          an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
          any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
          well. Good job Django, well done.

          EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
          As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
          and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
          million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
          TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
          million other visitors.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's everybody staring at?

                         DJANGO
          They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's this bizarre obsession they have
          with. you not riding horses?

                         DJANGO
          You askin' me?
          Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
          a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
          done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So what other archaic rituals are you people
          verboten to take part in?
          As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
          you can do, and what you can't do, and if
          you can't do it, why can't you do it?
          Like for instance, what if we were to walk
          in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
          order a drink, and drink it?
          Would the authorities frown on that?

                         DJANGO
          Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What part would they find the most offensive?









                         13

                         DJANGO
          All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
          I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
          at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
          And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
          with no white man, in public.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So if you and I did those things, that would
          be considered enough of a infraction to make
          the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

                         DJANGO
          You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
          The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well in that case Django, after you.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django you're going to have to learn to trust
          me, and as the man said; "There's no time
          like the,present."
          He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
          establishment.

          INT - SALOON - MORNING
          The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
          saloon.
          The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
          table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
          away from the two patrons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
          weary travelers.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
          for about a hour. But by then we'll be
          servin' breakfast -
          He turns around and sees them.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
          get that nigger outta here.









                         IT

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
          of the bar to get the Sheriff.
          When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
          the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
          jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
          on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
          and that would fall under the domain of the
          Sheriff.
          The Saloon Keeper runs away.
          The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
          The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
          from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

                         DJANGO
          What kinda dentist are you?
          This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
          Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
          like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
          it's a disaster - But these days I practice
          a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
          This gets no reaction from Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
          The Black Man shakes his head, no.
          As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

                         HE EXPLAINS;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well the way the slave trade deals in
          human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
          deals in corpses.









                         15
          Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
          The state places a bounty on a man's head.
          I track that man, I find that man, I kill
          that man. After I've killed him, I transport
          that man's corpse back to the authorities -
          and sometimes that's easier said then done.
          I show that corpse to the authorities -
          proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
          - At which point, the authorities pay me
          the bounty.
          (lifting his beer)
          Cheers.
          The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

                         DJANGO
          What's a bounty?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's like a reward.

                         DJANGO
          You kill people and they give you a reward?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Certain people, yes.

                         DJANGO
          White people?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

                         DJANGO
          Bad people?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Badder they are, bigger the reward.
          Which brings me to you, and I must admit
          I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
          to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
          On the other hand, I need your help,
          and if you're not in a position to refuse,
          all the better. So for the time being,
          I'm going to make this slave malarkey
          work to my benefit.

                         (BEAT)
          Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
          So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
          an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
          however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
          disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
          what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

          ???. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
          Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.

          BACK TO DJANGO

                         DJANGO
          I know what they look like, all right.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
          with me till we find them -

                         DJANGO
          - Where we goin'?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I hear at least two of them are overseeing
          up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
          That means we visit every plantation in
          Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
          find them, you point them out, and I kill
          them. You do that, I agree to give you
          your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
          Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
          dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
          I've already gave him to you -- but once the
          final Brittle brother lies dead in the
          dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
          new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
          included.
          Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
          Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
          watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
          Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
          Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
          As they do, The Sheriff says;









                         1 2

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
          start trouble, and scare all these nice
          people? You ain't got nothin' better to
          do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
          and show your ass -
          From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
          toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

          .THEN...
          A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
          apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
          FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
          The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
          The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
          dirt.
          The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
          As is Django.
          As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
          his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

                         PEDESTRIAN
          What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
          Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
          skull, killing him dead.
          In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
          Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now you can go get the marshall.

          U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Move that buckboard over there long ways
          across the street from the saloon. And I
          want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
          And I want two men with two rifles on this
          roof, and two men with two rifles on that
          roof, with all barrels pointed at that
          front door. And somebody git poor Bill
          outta the goddamn street.









                         LP
          Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
          building across the street from the saloon.
          The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
          The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.

          WHEN...

          COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...

          INT - SALOON - DAY
          Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
          He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
          player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
          who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
          on the window.
          Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
          including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
          He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          I think they wonderin' why you playin'
          the piana'.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good.

                         (PAUSE)
          But what are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
          around out front, now they hidin' behind it
          with guns. And a buncha other white folks
          are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
          down here.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
          marshall out there?

                         DJANGO
          If the one I think is the.marshall is the
          marshall, he's out there.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What makes you think he's the marshall?

                         DJANGO
          Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          You in the saloon!
          Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          We got eleven Winchesters on every way
          outta that buildin'! You got once chance
          git outta this alive! You and your nigger
          come out right now with your hands over
          your head, and I mean, right now!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          First things first! Is this the marshall
          I have the pleasure of addressing?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
          myself of all weapons, and just as you
          have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
          with my hands raised above my head.
          I trust as a representative of the
          criminal justice system of The United
          States of America, I shant be shot down
          in the street, by either you or your deputies,
          before I've had my day in court.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
          'em down like a dog in the street!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
          have your word as a lawman not to shoot
          me down like a dog in the street?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
          somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
          cheat the hangman in my town!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!








          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO DJANGO)
          They're a little tense out there. So don't
          make any quick movements, and let me do
          the talking.
          Django looks at him like, "as if..."

          EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
          A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
          Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
          The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
          outside.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You unarmed?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
          address you, your deputies, and apparently
          the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
          incident that just occurred?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Go on!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
          yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
          court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
          who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
          to elect as their sheriff, who went by
          the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
          wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
          with a price on his head of two hundred
          dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
          or alive.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          The hell you say!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
          news. But I'm willing to wager this man
          was elected sheriff sometime in the last
          two years. I know this because. three years
          ago he was rustling cattle from,
          The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
          Lubbock Texas.









                         Z/
          Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
          In my possession. is a warrant made out by
          circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
          of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
          He will back up who I am, and who your
          dear departed sheriff was.
          The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
          Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In other words marshall, you owe me
          two hundred dollars.

                         CUT TO

          EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
          together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
          Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
          business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
          Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
          Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
          times. A man who survives, is a man with
          a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
          a good plan. So, having said that, what's
          your plan, young Django?

                         DJANGO
          What'cha mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, after this Brittle business is behind
          us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
          seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
          What's your plan after that?

                         DJANGO
          Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
          Do most slaves take the institution of
          matrimony seriously?

                         DJANGO
          Huh?









                         ZZ
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do slaves believe in marriage'?

                         DJANGO
          Me and my wife do.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Where is she now?

                         DJANGO
          I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
          and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
          She got sold two days 'fore me.
          But I don't know who to.
          Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Care for some jerky?

                         DJANGO
          Sure.
          Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

                         SCHULTZ SAYS;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
          purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
          where she is?
          A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
          the dilemma, then pronounces;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
          So how long ago did all this happen?

                         DJANGO
          A few months ago.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Three or four?

                         DJANGO
          Three.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
          and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
          Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
          monthsago?
          Django nods his head, yes.









                         Z3
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The bad part about slavery being a business,
          is it's immoral. The good part about it being
          a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
          in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
          name in it, and the name of the customer who
          bought her, and more then likely their address.
          But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
          pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
          not going to get you very far in Greenville.
          Not to mention a slave auction town in
          Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
          visit. Free or not.

                         DJANGO
          I'll have my freedom papers.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes you will. But say you show them to some
          rascals, and they take them from you and
          tear them up?

                         DJANGO
          They could do that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm not saying they would, but they could.

                         DJANGO
          They do that I'll kill 'em.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
          man. The point being is the place,is just
          too dangerous for you.

                         DJANGO
          Well I gotta go, when do I go?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you get more dangerous.

          Versailles.
          Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
          You're playing a character. Your character
          is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
          Remember what I told you. During the act,
          you can never break character.

                         CUT TO

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
          We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
          blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
          BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
          riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
          As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
          steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
          stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
          wonder at this sight.
          The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
          a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
          mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
          man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
          While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
          majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
          FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
          The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
          As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
          in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
          BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
          Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
          at the darkee on the horse.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          It's against the law for niggers to ride
          horses in this territory.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

                         SPENCER BENNETT

          he can ride what he pleases.

          Not on my.property, around my niggers
          he can't.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
          wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
          My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
          valet, Django, and these are our horses,
          Fritz, and Tony.
          Fritz, does his head bow.
          This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
          are a gentleman, and a business man.
          And it is in these capacities that we've
          ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
          with you now.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          State your business.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I wish to purchase one of your
          nigger gals.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
          Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
          no appointment, no nuttin'?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm afraid so.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
          your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
          sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
          say about that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
          I've been led to believe you to be,
          I have five thousand things I might say,
          that could change your mind.
          i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
          Spencer laughs.

          The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
          Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Maybe while we discuss business, you
          could provide one of your loveliest black
          creatures to escort Django here around
          your magnificent grounds.

          A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
          BETINA, snaps to attention.

                         SPENCER
          Betina sugar, take Django around the
          grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

                         BETINA
          As you please, Big Daddy.
          Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
          free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
          Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
          treated as an extension of myself.

                         SPENCER
          Understood., Schultz. Betina?

                         BETINA
          Yes, sir?

                         SPENCER
          Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
          man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
          him like any of these other niggers around
          here, cause he ain't like any of these
          other niggers around here. Ya got it?









                         BETINA
          Ya want I should treat 'em like white
          folks?

                         SPENCER
          No that's not what I said.

                         BETINA
          Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Yes, I can see that.

                         (HE THINKS)
          What's the name of that peckawood boy from
          town works with the glass? His mama works
          at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
          the winda's when we have a problem?
          The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

          MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
          Oh, you mean Jerry.

                         SPENCER
          Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

                         (TO BETINA)
          You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

                         BETINA
          Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Well that's it then... just treat 'em
          like you would Jerry.

          EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
          Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
          Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
          him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
          the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

                         BETINA
          What'cha do for your massa'?

                         DJANGO
          Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

                         BETINA
          So you really free?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.









                         ZY

                         BETINA
          You mean you wanna dress like that?
          Django fumes.

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
          Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
          lemonade.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I've been'told by those who should know,
          the most exquisite African flesh in the
          state of Tennessee is bred right here on
          your land. And from the look of these
          black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

                         SPENCER
          Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
          faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
          field. But the lion share of my lady
          niggers are real show pony's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
          pony for young Django. So the only
          question that remains is, do you have a
          nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

                         SPENCER
          Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
          is practically my middle name.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
          Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
          The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

                         DJANGO
          Betina, come over here, I need to ask
          you something.
          He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
          pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

                         BETINA
          What'cho want?

                         DJANGO
          I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
          brothers. Overseers. Their name is
          Brittle. Do you know 'em?

                         BETINA
          Brittle?









                         DJANGO
          Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
          And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

                         BETINA
          I don't know dem.

                         DJANGO
          They could be usin' a different name.
          They woulda' come to the plantation in
          the last year.

                         BETINA
          You mean The Shaffer's?

                         DJANGO
          Maybe? Three brother?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Are they here?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Can you point one of 'em out to me?

                         BETINA
          Well ones over in that field.
          She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
          in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
          Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
          takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
          Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
          his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
          field landscape.

                         SPYGLASS POV:
          Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
          who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
          observation.

          DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

          BRANDING IRON.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
          he lowers the glass.

                         (INNOCENTLY)
          Is that who you lookin' for?

                         DJANGO
          Yep.
          He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

                         DJANGO
          Where's the other two?

          BETINA.
          They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
          for breakin' eggs.

                         DJANGO
          They whippin' Little Jody?
          She nods her head, yes.

                         DJANGO
          Point me in that direction.
          She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

                         BETINA
          You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
          Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

                         DJANGO
          Go git that white man, I came here with.
          He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
          Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
          and The Brittle Brothers.

                         FLASH ON
          A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
          wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
          PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
          LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
          Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

          BULLWHIP.
          DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.









                         3/

                         DJANGO
          Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
          She's real sorry!
          The WHIP RIPS her back.

                         DJANGO

                         (SCREAMING)
          Goddamit, Big John!

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
          Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
          Brittle with everything he has.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

                         FLASH ON
          Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

                         KNEELING DJANGO;

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          I like the way you beg, boy.

          EXT - STABLE - DAY
          Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
          to a dead tree stump.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
          LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
          ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
          yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
          are clumsy. You'd break everything in
          goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
          only known cure for nigger clumsiness
          is a peelin'.
          Little Jody begs to differ.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
          Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
          who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
          BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
          little dogs no nevermind.









                         3 2-

          BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.

                         BIG JOHN
          After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

                         DJANGO
          turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
          him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

          WHEN ...
          .DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

                         DJANGO
          John Brittle!
          Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
          length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
          stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
          Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
          Bulldogs.
          LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
          the same thing in the mirror.
          LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
          BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
          DJANGO just stares back.
          BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
          So does Roger.

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Django?
          Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
          shake his hand ...

                         DJANGO
          Remember me?
          .Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
          contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
          bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

          BIG JOHN FACE
          goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
          heart, at Django.

                         DJANGO
          I like the way you die, boy.









                         3 3
          Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
          LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
          FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
          it.
          LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
          gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
          gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
          It goes off... BANG.
          SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
          The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
          DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
          LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
          MORE SLAVES gather.

          DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
          whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
          Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
          To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
          Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
          Django, and the two dead bodies.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Who are they?

                         DJANGO
          That's John Brittle, and that's his
          little brother Raj.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Where's Ellis?

                         DJANGO
          He's the one hightailin' it across that
          field right now.
          Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
          to make an escape.

                         SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
          goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Are you sure that's him?
          Ellis gets further away...









                         DJANGO
          Yes!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Are you positive?
          Ellis gets further away...

                         DJANGO
          I dunno.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You don't know if you're positive?
          Ellis gets further away...

                         DJANGO
          I don't know what, positive,'means.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It means you're sure.

                         DJANGO
          Yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, what?

                         DJANGO
          Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

          BAM!
          The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
           The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
          RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
          The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
          Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
          and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
          The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
          Django does the same with his pistol.
          Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!

                         SPENCER
          Just who the hell are you two jokers?









                         35;
          Dr???. SCHULTZ
          I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
          of the criminal justice system of the
          United States of America. The man to my
          left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
          In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
          court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
          Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
          alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
          Roger Brittle --

                         DJANGO
          - They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know them by the name, Shaffer.
          But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
          These are wanted men. The law wants them
          for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
          states dead or alive. When Django and myself
          executed these men on sight, we were operating
          within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
          passions are high. But I must warn you,
          the penalty for taking deadly force
          against a officer of the court in the
          performance of his duty is, you will be
          hung by the neck until you are dead.
          This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
          After his dramatic pause for effect...
          .Dr.Schultz says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I please remove the warrant from my
          pocket so you may examine it?
          Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
          paper.

                         SPENCER
          Gimmie.
          Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
          the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
          what it says.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Satisfied.
          Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I have that back?

          ,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We good?

                         BENNETT
          Get off my land.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Post haste.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          Load up the bodies as quickly as
          you can, and let's get out of
          here.

                         TIME CUT
          All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
          the bounty hunters brought with them.
          Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
          With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
          start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
          for one final threat.

                         BENNETT
          Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
          while you on my property. But for lettin' a
          nigger kill a white man, and especially for
          letting a nigger kill a white man in a
          audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
          it out of the county alive. Mark my words
          Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
          gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
          from my motherfuckin' gate.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
          regulator playmates aren't shy about
          killing for what you believe in. But mark
          my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
          towards Django or myself, you better be
          prepared to die for it.
          The two men ride off.
          The Black and White Audience watch them go.

          lying on his belly in the grass.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          That's them sonsabitches.

                         SPENCER'S POV:
          We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
          Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
          lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
          We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
          CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
          The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
          Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
          all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
          holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
          Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
          steed..

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Now unless they start shootin' first,
          nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
          for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
          nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
          personally, strip and clip that garboon
          myself.
          Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
          head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
          this thing.
          He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
          holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.

                         BRADSHAW
          We ready, or what?

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.

                         (RIPS)
          Shit ...I just made it worse.
          He rips. it off his head in frustration.

                         RANDY
          I can't see shit either.

                         REDFISH
          Who made this goddamn shit?

          Willards wife.

                         WILLARD
          Well make you own goddamn masks!

                         SPENCER

                         (TO WILLARD)
          Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate
          what Jenny did.

                         REDFISH
          Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
          could cut it better then this.

          0. B.
          How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?

                         ROBERT
          Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
          I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
          But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
          all over, and I'm riding blind.
          Randy tears at his bag.

                         RANDY
          Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
          He puts it on-then says;

                         RANDY
          Yep, it's worse.
          He yanks it off his head.

                         RANDY
          Did anybody bring any extra bags?

                         TERRY
          No, no one brought a extra bag!









                         3 9

                         RANDY
          I'm just asking.

                         DOUG
          Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

                         SPENCER
          Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
          up, that just defeats the purpose.
          Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.

                         REDFISH
          I can't see in this fucking thing!
          I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
          And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

                         WILLARD
          Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
          my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
          ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
          And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
          From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
          Willard rides off.
          O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.

                         SPENCER
          O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
          not dead.

          O.B.
          But Willards riding off.

                         SPENCER
          Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
          here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
          And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

                         RANDY
          Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
          Robert takes off his bag, and says;

                         ROBERT
          I think we all think the bags was a nice
          idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
          could of been done better. So how 'bout,
          no bags this time, but next time, we do the
          bags right, and then we go full regalia.
          Everyone takes off their bag.

                         SPENCER
          Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!









                         YO

                         TERRY
          But nobody can see.

                         SPENCER
          So?

                         TERRY
          So, it would be nice to see.

                         SPENCER
          Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
          can't see, so what? All that matters is can
          the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
          Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

          EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
          The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
          the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
          haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
          ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
          don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
          everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

          WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
           OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
          "Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
          off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
          Then amongst the confusion...

          WE SNAP ZOOM TO

          A BIG TREE
          on the other side of the lake
          Then quickly cut into The Tree.
          Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ
          with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.

          SCOPE SIGHT POV
          The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are

          Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Just fire into the smoke.
          The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.

          INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
          pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
          bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
          bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
          sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
          Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
          still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
          worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
          more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
          ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
          dogs.

          Referring to the scope sight rifle;

          I like.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, I think while they take this opportunity
          to lick their wounds, we should take this
          opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
          They hop out of the tree.

          first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
          purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
          with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
          handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
          Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
          He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
          on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as
          his winter coat.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
          dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
          You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
          You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
          even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
          You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

                         DJANGO
          She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
          If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
          where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
          were sayin' where I gotta go first?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There'should be some sort of records office.
          You know when she was sold, you know where
          she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
          you know her name ... . what is her name?

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda.
          Schultz reacts.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Broomhilda?
          Django.nods his head yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Were her owners German?
          Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
          The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
          a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
          speak a little German too.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Your wife?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
          her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So let me get this straight, your slave
          wife speaks German, and her name is
          Broomhilda Von Shaft...?









                         DJANGO
          Yep. Mouthful, huh?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          To say the least.
          (stopping the horse)
          This looks like a very pretty place to have
          our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
          The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
          Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
          cup of tea.

                         DJANGO
          How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
          were German?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
          her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

                         DJANGO
          Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
          a character in one of the most popular of
          all the German legends.

                         DJANGO
          Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes there is.

                         DJANGO
          Do you know it?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Every German knows that story. Would you
          like me to tell you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
          daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
          Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

                         DJANGO
          What she do.?








          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
          him in some way. So at first he's just going to
          obliterate her -

                         DJANGO
          Obliterate... . what does that mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like blow up.
          He pantomimes a explosion.

                         DJANGO
          Phew, that's pretty mad.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
          little time, he calms down a bit. He's
          still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
          Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
          does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda's on a mountain?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's a German legend, there's always going
          to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
          puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
          fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
          And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
          And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
          arises brave enough to save her.

                         DJANGO
          Does a fella arise?
          From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
          wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
          named, Sigfried.

                         DJANGO
          Does Sigfried save her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
          Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
          a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
          said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
          obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
          his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
          not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
          he's not afraid.of him.








          Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
          He walks through hellfire because
          Broomhilda's worth. it.
          After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
          as they nibble on their sandwiches.

                         DJANGO
          I know how he feels.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I think I'm just starting to realize that.
          He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
          thinks about what he's going to say next.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
          save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
          let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
          Let me ask you a question, how do you like
          the bounty hunting business?

                         DJANGO
          Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
          What's not to like?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I hafta admit, we make a good team.

                         DJANGO
          But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
          Big John and Rodger?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
          overzealous. But normally, that's a good
          thing. How'd you like to partner up for
          the winter?

                         DJANGO
          What'd ya mean partner up?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
          of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
          of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
          three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
          over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
          Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
          A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
          for the winter.

                         DJANGO
          You makin' another agreement?









                         W7
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes. You work with me through the winter,
          till the snow melts. I give you a third
          of my bounties. And while we're together,
          I'll teach you a few things you're going
          to need to know.

                         DJANGO
          Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
          head bow thing that Fritz can do?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That among other things. We make some
          money this winter, when the snow melts,
          I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
          we'll find where they sent your wife.
          I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
          No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
          understandably, he's a little suspicious.

                         DJANGO
          Why you care what happens to me? Why you
          care if I find my wife?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well frankly, I've never given anybody
          their freedom before. And now that I have,
          I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
          just not ready to go off on your own, it's
          that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
          Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
          it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
          obliged to help you on your quest to
          rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
          Django accepts that response.
          What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
          Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
          ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
          really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
          Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

                         WE SEE
          A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
          Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
          By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
          to be good at this.

          EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
          been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
          PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
          case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.









          Y, 8

          DOWN BELOW WE SEE
          A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON
          helping him by leading the horse forward.
          On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Keep down or he'll see you.

                         DJANGO
          Who that farmer? Who cares?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
          just might.

                         DJANGO
          What? The little man pushin' that plow?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

                         DJANGO
          Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
          who's hiding out as a farmer, because
          there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
          his head.
          He hands Django the scope rifle case.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And he's all yours my boy.
          DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.

          SCOPE SIGHT POV:
          on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse
          and his son.
          Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
          folks for money?

                         DJANGO
          His son's with him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
          Maybe even share a last word. That's
          better then most get, and a damn. sight
          better then he deserves.









                         1???9
          Django still hesitates.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
          mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
          Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

                         DJANGO

                         (READING)
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
          The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
          stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
          for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
          hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
          Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
          follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and

          CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
          is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
          twenty-two, they would never of printed that.

                         (REFERRING TO

                         THE HANDBILL)
          But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
          and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
          You want to save your wife by doing what
          I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
          and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
          is worth seven thousand dollars.
          Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
          Django SHOOTS.
          The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
          The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out
          his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

                         DJANGO
          Why?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's good luck. You always keep the
          handbill of your first bounty.
          They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body,
          leading the extra body horse behind them.









                         50
          As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's
          Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his
          last words to his son before he dies.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          See, they're having a tender little father son
          moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
          they've ever had.

          EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
          It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
          Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
          a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
          heart would be.
          He DRAWS...
          Shoots the bottle heart!
          He DRAWS ...
          Shoots the left coal eye.
          He DRAWS ...
          Shoots the right coal eye.
          He DRAWS...
          Shoots the carrot nose.
          Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I think it's safe to say you're faster then
          the snowman.

          EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
          A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
          a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

          FROM ABOVE.

          DJANGO AND SCHULTZ
          up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them.

          EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
          the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
          with five corpses.









                         571
          The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
          and who the hell ya got there?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
          Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
          it down to the friendly peace officer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
          And three of their acolytes.

                         SHERIFF GUS
          Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
          nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
          'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
          snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

          TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
          They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
          coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
          liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
          bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
          third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
          "That one", Schultz says.
          Django RIPS IT off the wall.
          As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
          hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

          EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
          The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
          practices his fast draw against five men...
          .by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
          DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
          falls to the ground to get the fifth.
          He looks up from the ground at Schultz.









                         5L
          As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You're pretty confident aren't you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You have reason to be.
          He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
          All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
          top of Django.

                         DJANGO
          Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
          Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh you're ready for Greenville.
          He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
          sure.
          He blows out the match...

          WE GO TO BLACK
          What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
          slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
          steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
          He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

                         CUT TO

          EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
          The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
          brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
          have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.









                         53
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
          the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
          selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
          BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
          LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
          through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
          along.
          BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
          PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
          A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
          SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

          THE KIDS ALONG.
          Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
          A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:

                         GREENVILLE

          CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
          Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
          other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
          Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
          Greenville operates.
          As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
          MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
          Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
          The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
          Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
          outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
          wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
          Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
          PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

          WE FLASH ON
          The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.

          INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
          amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
          pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
          A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
          SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.

                         JUDD
          Good god almighty these niggers stink!

          Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
          well, I'm only gonna say this once.
          There's a slave corral right across from
          this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
          doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you

          you can!
          The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
          run full out from the train to the steer corral.
          We spot Django during the running.
          Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
          COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

          INSIDE THE CORRAL
          through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
          the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
          view.
          Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other
          LADIES, then she's gone from view.

          BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT)

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

          Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books.
          We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man
          enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
          RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words

          INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
          The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
          the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
          Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
          Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

          EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
          We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
          WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
          the leg irons scrap her ankles.
          Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
          in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
          perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
          Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
          to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
          Street.
          Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
          was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
          buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
          so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

                         BROOMHILDA
          looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
          breath which one will buy her.
          Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
          the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
          twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.








          Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
          he nudges his dad.
          The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
          back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
          branded in her cheek.
          Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
          of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
          feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

          SELLER - CLYDE
          Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
          nigger gal gentle.

          Broomhilda notices that. And makes more eye contact with Scotty.
          They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
          A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.









                         NARRATOR (VO)
          On that day, eight months ago, the auction
          was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
          for his fat boy son Scotty.
          Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
          From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
          Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
          the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

                         SCOTTY
          This is for you.
          She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.

                         SCOTTY
          They're jelly beans. Try one.
          She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.

                         SCOTTY
          Good huh?
          She nods her head, yes.
          We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
          back eating her bag of jelly beans.

          $XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
          back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
          Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
          Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
          realize the young master is the shy type.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Master Scotty... ?

                         SCOTTY
          Yes Broomhilda?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
          you on that seat so we can talk?

                         SCOTTY
          Please, I'd love that.
          She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.









                         '8

          EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
          A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
          The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
          buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
          Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her son, and
          his new bought nigger gal.
          The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
          Mrs.HARMONY
          What's your name, gal?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Broomhilda.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          Follow me. into the kitchen,
          ('to her son)
          You stay out here.

          INT - KITCHEN - DAY
          Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
          that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
          Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
          Mrs.HARMONY
          I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
          my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
          girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
          with him, they fool with him for the wrong
          reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
          man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
          He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
          eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
          wrong, you'll deal with me.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
          needs is a little confidence.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          And you'll give that to him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
          Mrs.HARMONY
          He is, isn't he?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Ah-huh.
          The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
          bride for young master Scotty that day.
          And the two kids had a nice time playing
          house for awhile.
          We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
          the daytime..
          At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
          At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
          Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
          no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
          even join the family at their dinner table.
          We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
          gravy.

          NARRATOR.(VO)
          And pretty soon she was adopted into a
          member of the family.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          After three months of this bliss,
          Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
          a romantic weekend in Greenville.

          SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
          drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a
          fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,
          complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol.
          Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best
          described as plantation pimp daddy.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          White masters would take their pretty
          Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
          excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
          how bad the other slaves had it, always made
          the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
          position, (just in case they'd forgot).

                         BROOMHILDA
          holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the
          OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.

          INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
          Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel
          lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.

          Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the

          INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
           Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
          showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.

                          NARRATOR (VO)
          And two, there was a sliver of society that
          ran through Greenville at night that catered
          to white masters who were infected with a
          condition that was normally referred to as,
          "Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
          bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
          white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

          INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean
          white men and black women).
          Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining
          room.
          We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
          sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.

                         SCOTTY
          I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
          I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
          I love you. And if loving you means I go to
          hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
          That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
          was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Then... speak of the devil and the devil
          appears.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          appears at their table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
          The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
          to welcome an attractive couple'like
          yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
          Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.

                         SCOTTY
          Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
          We love it here.
          Pointing at a empty chair.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          May I join you?-

                         SCOTTY
          Please, by all means.
          Calvin sits down.
          Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
          Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long have you been a member?









                         SCOTTY
          We just joined this weekend.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well our little private oasis appreciates
          your patronage. Some may consider the dues
          excessive, but they're necessary for us to
          create this haven for the alternative
          lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

                         SCOTTY
          Well said, and money well spent.
          He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
          Candie sees this.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It would be.my pleasure, your first
          weekend at the club, to join me and my
          friends at my table.
          Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
          But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
          She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
          with a, "Don't be silly."
          We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
          join the party.
          Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
          is a little more revealing then the others.
          They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
          Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
          keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
          to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
          to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
          disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
          Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
          We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          After excusing herself, she walked across
          the street to her hotel room. She got
          her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
          didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
          Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
          home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
          She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
          to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
          scrape every pimple.









                         '3

          ???-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB
          The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.

                         NARRATOR (VO)
          Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
          wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
          card game. As the game wore on, it came down
          to a two thousand dollar pot between
          Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
          for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
          Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
          something in his ear.

                         CANDIE

                          (TO SHEBA)
          Really?

                         (TO SCOTTY)
          You know what Sheba just tole me?
          Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;

                         SCOTTY
          What?

                         CANDIE
          She says she thinks you're cute.

                         SCOTTY
          Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
          beautiful.
          Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

                         CANDIE
          Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
          lip. Want some lip?
          Scotty, is a little surprised.

                         SCOTTY
          Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

                         CANDIE
          Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
          friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
          Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
          intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
          Calvin's side of the table.
          The game continues.









                         G

                         CANDIE
          Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
          brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
          it. If you're really holding cards, time to
          pony up. I raise you five hundred.
          Candie throws in his chips.

          SCOTTY.
          I see your five hundred...
          (throws in chips)
          .and raise you four hundred more.
          (tosses his last chips)
          Call.
          This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Not so fast, boy.

                         (BEAT)
          Pot ain't fat enough yet.

                         SCOTTY
          I'm all in.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Ain't that too bad.
          Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
          pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.

                         SCOTTY
          I would think a southern gentleman of
          such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
          to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
          Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          One final raise.
          Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's Sheba's bill of sale.

                         SCOTTY
          What? I don't want her.
          Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
          More laughter.









                         CALVIN CANDIE
          In Greenville slaves are currency. And
          Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
          I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
          fold?

                         SCOTTY
          I'm all out of money.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But we ain't playin' for money no more..
          We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
          you got.

                         SCOTTY
          I can't bet Broomhilda.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
          or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
          and a pencil.
          Somebody does.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
          Scotty makes a pressured decision.
          He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
          Broomhilda.

                         SCOTTY
          Let me see your cards!
          Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
          What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.

                         SCOTTY
          You cheated me.
          After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What did you just call me?

                         SCOTTY
          I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
          cause that's what you are!
          Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer
          Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty.
          Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
          himself .









                         66
          Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
          in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
          I challenge you to a duel.
          (to the Piano

                         PLAYER)
          Piano player, will you hit three separate
          notes?

                         (TO SCOTTY)
          On the third note, pick up the gun and
          try to kill me.
          (to Piano player)
          Piano player please ...
          This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

                         SCOTTY
          Wait a minute ...no!

          FIRST NOTE ...

                         SCOTTY
          I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
          to duel!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then get out of here, get in your buggy
          and get out of town.

                         SCOTTY
          Sure. Let me just get my girl.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You lost that girl, fat boy.

          SECOND NOTE...

                         SCOTTY
          Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
          called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
          give you Broomhilda.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
          to fuckin' another one.

                         (BEAT)
          Or pick up that gun.
          Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his
          parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't
          leave.

          naked under the covers. Candie brings the belt down around her legs and
          backside.
          She hops out of bed.

                         CUT TO

          INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY
          Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
          The same room Django was sold in at the beginning.
          Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold
          fill the big hall.

          ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)
          stands half naked on the auction block.
          The SELLER' (SHELBY)
          gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding.
          Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including
          Calvin Candie.
          Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES
          /-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing.
          FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE
          We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW,
          always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler
          hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
          Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
          owner of Candyland.

                         DJANGO
          Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, so you heard of it?

                         DJANGO
          Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
          and apparently the repellent gentleman down
          there is the one who owns her.

          ??????` TIME CUT









                         6R
          The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction
          hall.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

                         DJANGO
          Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
          a couple niggers he'd fight.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you play a mandingo expert?

                         DJANGO
          What?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
          who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

                         DJANGO?€?
          Why?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Because when a man has one of the four
          biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
          the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
          is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
          his attention, we better be talking about
          big sweaty black males. So my character is
          that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
          in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
          fight game. And your character is the mandingo
          expert I hired to help me do it.

                         DJANGO
          They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          One-Eyed Charly?

                         DJANGO
          That's what you call it when you buy a slave
          expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
          know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
          He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
          don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
          Dr'. SCHULTZ
          Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?









                         70

                         DJANGO
          You know, back on the plantation, my. job
          wasn't historian.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
          legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
          play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
          yes, if you can't.

                         DJANGO
          You want me to play a black slaver? There
          ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
          slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
          buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
          Django gets that.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Can you do that?

                         DJANGO
          That, I can do. What's next?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          To get ourselves personally invited to
          Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.

           A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house. The DINERS

          special treat).

          The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
          elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.

          While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
          sarsaparilla.
          Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Have you ever seen anything like this

                         MOGUY
          You better watch out doctor, you gonna
          steal this little pony's heart.
          They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they

                         SAY;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How long have you been associated with
          Mr.Candie?

                         MOGUY
          Calvin and I were about eleven when we
          went to boarding school together. One
          could almost say, I was raised to be
          Calvin's lawyer.

                         DJANGO
          One could almost say, you a nigger.
          Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
          Mr.Moguy.

                         MOGUY
          What did you say?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
          Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
          know before I meet him?

                         MOGUY
          Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.









                         7EF
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What civilized people aren't?

                         MOGUY
          That's why all the French ambiance. And
          he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
          Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (FRENCH)
          What ever he prefers.
          This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.

                         MOGUY
          Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
          French to him, it'll embarrass him.
          They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
          Moguy slides the doors open...
          The party enters the billiard room.

          INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
           Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
          the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
          Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
          fight to death in this closed room.
          An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
          Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

          VASSEPI.
          Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
          and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Why do you want to get in the mandingo
          business?
          That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
          Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
          (referring to Moguy)
          .to make the proper introductions?
          Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;









                         7S

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Quit stalling and answer the question.
          The room is quiet.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The awful truth?

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm bored, and it seems like a good
          bit of fun.
          Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
          goin on that's a good bit of fun_
          Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
          The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
          Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
          CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
          Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
          death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

          CALVIN CANDIE.
          The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
          him today. What's his name, Moguy?

                         MOGUY
          Big Fred.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
          Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.

                         (TO AMERIGO)
          What's your nigger's name?

                         AMERIGO
          Luigi... .?
          Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
          Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
          named, ROSCOE tends it.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
          a good bit of fun?

                         DJANGO
          You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How'd you two like to try the signature drink
          of the club?









                         79
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We'd love to.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          (yelling to the

                         BARTENDER)
          Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
          don't spare the rum.
          Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
          Big Fred kills Luigi.
          Candie and his friends cheer.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
          like you owe me ten dollars.
          Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
           Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
          sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
          Candle turns his attention to Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's your name, boy?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          His name is Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          Where'd ya dig him up?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          A fortuitous turn of events brought
          Django and myself together.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO DJANGO)
          I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
          real bright boy.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm curious, what makes you such a
          mandingo expert?

                         DJANGO
          I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
          Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

                         BARTHOLOMEW
          What you say, boy?









                         77
          /???. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
          you directed your line of inquiry to me.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
          neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
          if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
          didn't seek you out for your advice. I
          sought you out to purchase a fighting
          nigger at above top dollar market price.
          I was'under the impression when you
          granted me an audience, it would be to
          discuss business.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          No we weren't talking business yet. We
          were discussing my curiosity.
          Now according to Moguy here, if I do
          business with you...

                         (POINTING TO

                         SCHULTZ)
          , .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

                          (POINTING TO

                         DJANGO)
          He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
          but more or less, yes.
          None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
          needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
          Candie turns his attention back to Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO DJANGO)
          So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
          looked over my African flesh, and were
          none too impressed.

                         FLASH ON
          we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..









          BACK TO CLEO CLUB

                         DJANGO
          Not for top dollar.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well then we got nothing more to talk
          about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
          from me, those are the beat ass niggers
          I wanna sell.

                         DJANGO
          He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
          sell. He wants the nigger you don't
          wanna sell.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
          sell.
          Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You won't sell your best. You won't even
          sell your second best. But your third
          best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
          I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
          forced to consider it... . who knows what
          could happen?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What do you consider ridiculous?
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          For a truly talented specimen,
          ."The Right Nigger"..:?
          How much would you say, Django?

                         DJANGO
          Twelve thousand dollars.
          Calvin Candle takes in the figure.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
          you got my attention.

                         TIME CUT

          TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner
          in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
          And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.









                         77

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
          Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO COCO)
          How's your Catfish, dew drop?

                         COCO
          Real good Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          You spend a lot of time around niggers
          aside from Freeman here?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Not so much.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
          treat this was for 'em. You feel special
          Coco?

                         COCO
          Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You feel special Bartholomew?

                         BARTHOLOMEW
          Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
          He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

                         SHEBA
          Yep.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
          special?

                         DJANGO

                         (MEANING SHEBA)
          Not as special as her.
          The table breaks out in laughter.









                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well we're leaving bright and early
          tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
          kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
          You oughta come with us.
          Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
          suppose I could be amenable to that.
          How far must we trek?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
          in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
          There you can get a look at my best
          specimens. Have dinner with my sister
          and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
          my guest.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid.
          Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.

                         WE CUT

          EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
          It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
          "Candyland."
          Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
          (BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
          Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
          with'supplies.
          FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
          SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
          walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
          possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.

          THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
          WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
          walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
          possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
          pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
          with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.









                         J

                         RODNEY
          walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
          slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
          the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.

                         FLASH ON
          Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.

                         RODNEY
          gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.

          DJANGO ON TONY
          sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
          that shit stand.
          He yells down to the powerless man;

                         DJANGO
          Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
          Rodney looks away.

                         RODNEY
          No sir.

                         DJANGO
          You want a boot heel in it?

                         RODNEY
          No sir.

                         DJANGO
          Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
          Flash that bad look at me again,
          I'll give ya reason not to like me!
           As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
          not without difficulty.
          Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          How do you like this side of the slave
          trade?

                         DJANGO
          Not so much.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Prefer the other side?

                         DJANGO
          I didn't say that.








          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

                         DJANGO
          Are you sure it's her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          He didn't call her by name, but she's a
          young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
          speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
          assume, in this instance, I think it's
          pretty safe.

                         DJANGO
          Did you offer to buy her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I opened the door to my possible interest.
          But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
          so interested.

          SUDDENLY ...
          Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Am I intruding?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Of course not.

          I swear you two are cozier then a couple
          of cuttle fish.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You'd be surprised what a good
          conversationalist Django is.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh by now, I don't think that would
          surprise meat all.
          Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
          Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When do we reach your property?

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          You been on it. I own the whole sixty
          miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
          Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

                         (YELLING BEHIND
          him at Billy)
          Billy Crash, git up here!
          Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
          rides up.

                         BILLY CRASH
          Yeah, Boss?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Find out what that goddamn commotion
          is up at the tracker shack!

                         BILLY CRASH
          Right away, Boss.
          Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know, confidentially, just 'tween
          us girls, worse things about this
          business, ain't the slaves. It's all
          the white trash ya gotta deal with.
          Like these peckawoods we got riding with
          us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
          ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
          niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
          holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
          it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
          And don't think they don't know it either.
          It's about the only thing these dumbass
          motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
          Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
          niggers ass, other than somebody might as
          well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
          boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
          they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
          inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
          gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
          a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
          patience, that German lady taught Hildi
          how to speak German.
          Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
          ???, emotions betray nothing.

          Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
          hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
          understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
          could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
          of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
          to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
          wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
          they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.

          What the hell's goin on?

                         BILLY CRASH
          They got 'em a runaway.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Who?

                         CUT TO

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
          A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
          slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
          A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
          bunkhouse.
          The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
          long haired lot.
          Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
          JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
          or just from the same hollow.
          Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
          GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
          GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of

          MARSHA.
          A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
          surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
          One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
          fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
          been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
          not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
          mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
          patch.









                         O V5
          The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
          the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
          Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
          down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
          old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
          a fool thing like run off?

                         D'ARTAGNAN
          I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
          win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
          shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
          myself think!
          Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
          Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
          (to the other

                         TRACKERS)
          Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
          he's just makin' em hungry.
          The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long was he loose?
          Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          A.night. Day. Half the other night.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How far he git off property?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
          considering that limp he got.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
          Friday?.

                         MOGUY
          (pointing behind him)
          One of this new lot.









                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
          wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.

                         (TO D'ARTAGNAN)
          Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
          a tail on a teddy bear.
          D'Artagnan starts begging.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
          soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
          Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
          business. Now I done paid five hundred
          dollars for you. And when I pay five
          hundred dollars, I expect to get five
          fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
          and play dead. You've fought three fights.

                         D'ARTAGNAN
          I won every one.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
          muddied the line between winning and losing.
          Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
          on the ground.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
          dollars, I want five fights. So what
          about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
          reimburse me?
          The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
          This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
          Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
          The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
          watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
          The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
          know what to expect from their new home.
          Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
          bastard.
          Calvin prods further.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You even know what reimburse means?









                         E 17
          The Whites laugh.
          Then SUDDENLY ...
          .The German Speaks;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'll reimburse you.
          All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
          Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
          Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
          direction of the good German.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You will?
          Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
          one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
          broom?
          Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.

                         DJANGO
          No he won't.
          All eyes turn to Django.

                         DJANGO
          He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
          all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
          ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
          we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
          right, Doc?
          Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
          to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
          billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO CANDIE)
          You heard 'em.
          The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
          green jacket, slack jawed.
          !` Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.









                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
          jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
          like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
          Mr. Stonesipher?
          Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          That's right.
          Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
          Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well now since you won't pay a penny for
          this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
          this nigger however I see fit?

                         DJANGO
          He's your nigger.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
          bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Marsha...git 'em!
          The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
          Shepherds back.
          The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...

                         THE MANDINGOS
          all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
          The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
          As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
          Candie.staring contest with Django...
          Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
          the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
          The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
          The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
          Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
          appears not to enjoy it.
          Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
          ???-. to Django.









                         P9

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Your boss looks a little green around
          the gills for a blood sport like
          nigger fightin'?
          As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.

                         DJANGO
          Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
          ripped apart by dogs, is all.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But you are use to it?

                         DJANGO
          Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
          a little more use to American's then
          he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
          ready, we rode five hours so you could
          show off your stock. Let's git to it.
          Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
          ain't impressed.
          Calvin...BLINK...
          Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
          his horse, then looks at the black man.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Follow me.
          The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
          apart.

          EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
          The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
          own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
          As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
          picking it.
          The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
          Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
          Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
          INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
          the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
          natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
          One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
          in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
          He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
          Django.









                         90
          All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
          get a better look at the black riding a horse.
          Django looks back matching their stare.

          EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
          The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
          As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
          (very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
          a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
          among his SHEEP.
          KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
          Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
          begins tossing them about.
          The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
          This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

          THEN ...
          .DJANGO rides by.
          The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
          overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
          Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
          same village.
          And they too see Django ... . WOW!
          The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
          or The Big House as everyone calls it.
          To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
          night nigger fights.
          All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
          family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
          hands) come out to greet the caravan.
          They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
          procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
          As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
          huge dust cloud behind it.
          Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
          ???. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
          the Big House to greet her brother.








          Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
          steps...

                         STEPHEN
          eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
          Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
          and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
          of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
          South. -
          Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
          (almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
          Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
          scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
          for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
          The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
          The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

          THEN...
          Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
          All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
          and for a moment don't know what to think.
          Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
          As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
          it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
          limp.
          All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
          Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hello Stephen my boy!

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
          this nigger up on that nag?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
          shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
          on that nag?

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          Hey Snowball.








          : Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.

                         DJANGO
          If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
          my horse, you ask me.

                         STEPHEN
          Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
          horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
          goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
          funny. Django's a Freeman.
          Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.

                         STEPHEN
          This nigger, here?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
          the two of. you. Django, this is another
          cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
          Stephen, this is Django. You two should
          hate each other.
          Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
          blacks at Candyland.

                         STEPHEN
          Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
          feel the need to entertain?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
          are customers, and they are our guests
          Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
          .are to show them every hospitality.
          Do you understand that?

                         STEPHEN
          I don't know why I gotta -

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You don't hafta know why, do you
          understand?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Good. They're spending the night. Go up
          in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

                         (POINTING AT

                         DJANGO)
          He's gonna stay in the Big House?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

                         STEPHEN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          In the Big House?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You gotta problem with that?

                         STEPHEN
          I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
          problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
          and the pillow cases once this black ass
          motherfuckers gone!

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
          Your problem, right now, is making a
          good impression. And I want you to start
          solving that problem right now, and git
          them rooms ready.
          The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;

                         STEPHEN
          Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
          Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
          Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
          to her brother on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
          is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
          Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
          Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
          Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
          Django,
          (Django tips his hat)
          and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
          Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.








          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And it is our great delight to encounter
          this flaming rose.

                         LARA LEE
          Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
          You're not from around here, are you?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Actually I'm from a far off land,
          Dusseldorf, to be exact.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          These two are in the market for a fightin'
          nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
          show 'em my stock.

                         LARA LEE
          We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Half the reason I invited them. I thought
          you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
          little sister.
          Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
          All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
          two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
          Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
          CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
          Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
          As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
          Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know since I started fightin' niggers
          about eleven years ago, it's been a new
          lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
          now is the man responsible for all my
          success.
          Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
          Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
          Schultz.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Howdy Ace.

                         (TO SCHULTZ

                         AND DJANGO)
          This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
          nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
          Ace Woody.









                         915
          Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
          Cody.

                         (TO ACE)
          Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
          Django Freeman, they're big customers with
          big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
          brought 'em out here so you could give
          'em a little display of our African flesh.
          Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

                         ACE WOODY
          Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
          Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
          Django.
          Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
          Greenville to here.

                         ACE WOODY
          These the new chickens?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes siree bob.

                         ACE WOODY
          How many you get?

                         (HE COUNTS)
          One, two, three, four, five.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Five real strong bucks.

                         ACE WOODY
          How many you get rid of?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          We still got three left.
          Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
          Leo Moguy chimes in;

                         MOGUY
          I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
          they'll be here tomorrow.
          Ace turns to Brown.









                         ACE WOODY
          Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
          the pen till tomorrow.
          Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
          the slave pen.
          Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
          Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.

                         ACE WOODY
          Y'all stand over there and make a line!
          They do.
          Ace climbs down from off his horse.
          Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
          Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
          Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
          Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What do you think?

                         ACE WOODY
          I think you lookin' for niggers to push
          a plow, 'dem your boys.
          Candie rolls his eyes.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's wrong with them?

                         ACE WOODY
          Hold it...hold it, you done bought
          r em, let me look at 'em.
          Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

                         ACE WOODY
          Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
          buy that one?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Which one?

                         ACE WOODY
          What you mean, which one? The one I'm
          pointing at, that one.









                         77

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Actually, that one was purchased by
          our mister Moguy.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO MOGUY)
          You bought him?

                         MOGUY
          Yes I did.

                         ACE WOODY
          Why?

                         MOGUY
          I like his prospects.

                         ACE WOODY
          His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
          I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
          Remind me again what prospects means?

                         MOGUY
          Hope for the future.
          Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.

                         ACE WOODY
          You got hope for his future?

                         MOGUY
          I did.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well I don't.
          Ace walks over to the slave in question.

                         ACE WOODY
          What's your name, boy?
          The mandingo says;

                         SIDNEY JAMES
          Sidney James, sir.

                         ACE WOODY
          So long Sidney James.
          Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
          Sidney James point blank in the belly.
          Everybody reacts.








          Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
          Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
          Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
          Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
          Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
          Ace looks up at his boss.

                         ACE WOODY
          Boss Candie, which one did you buy?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well to me the pick of the litter is
          Big Fred over there.

          A very scared Fred answers.

                         BIG FRED
          Yes, sir.

                         ACE WOODY

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers
          last night.

                         'ACE WOODY

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Beat 'em to death.
          Smiling impressively at Big Fred.

                         (TO FRED)
          Really?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
          but still, he still beat his ass
          to death.

                         ACE WOODY

                         BIG FRED
          Yes, sir.
          Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
          Candie acts out mock frustration.
          The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now why did you do that?

                         ACE WOODY
          He won his last fight last night.
          Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos

          Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.

                         ACE WOODY
          Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
          push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
          in the head.

          Welcome to Candyland, boys!
          Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
          Candie leans over to Schultz and says;

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          We only get about two out of every batch
          of five fighters we buy. But those two
          tend to be lucky.
          Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
          that you don't trust my judgement?
          Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Oh you know I always trust your judgement,

          Stephen, you're incorrigible.

                         (CON'T)
          There you can lie down and rest up
          for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
          some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
          my finer specimens.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid.
          Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
          Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
          Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
          of oats.
          Django hands the boy the reigns.

                         DJANGO
          That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
          care of 'em now.

                         TIMMY
          Yes, sir.
          Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.

                         DJANGO
          Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
          He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.

                         DJANGO
          Give that one to Fritz.
          Timmy leads the horses away.
          The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
          Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
          the nigger girl we were talking about?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Nigger girl?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I believe you said she spoke German?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?








          ,oz.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do you think before the demonstration you
          could send her around to my room?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I don't see why not.

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Stephen, when you get through showing
          them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
          I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
          and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
          Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

                         STEPHEN
          Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
           somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What?

                         STEPHEN
          Hildi's in The Hot Box.
          This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's she doin' there?

                         STEPHEN
          What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
          she bein punished.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What she do?

                         STEPHEN
          She ran away again.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
          when I was gone?

                         STEPHEN
          Two.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          When did she go?

                         STEPHEN
          Last night. They brought her back this
          morning.









                         CALVIN CANDLE
          How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
          Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
          those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
          motherfuckers right now.

                         STEPHEN
          Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
          D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
          lookin' for her and found her. She a little
          beat up, but she did that to herself.
          Runnin' through them damn bushes.
          Django's hand moves away from his gun.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          How long she been in the box?

                         STEPHEN
          What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
          fool got ten more days to go.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Take her out.

                         STEPHEN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Take her out? Why!

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
          my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
          hospitality dictates I make her available
          to him.

                         STEPHEN
          But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
          havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
          wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
          I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
          her out.
          (to Cora and

                         LARA LEE)
          Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
          for getting her cleaned up and presentable
          for Dr.Schultz?
          The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While
          Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.








          Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
          Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
          Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
          sizzling in it.
          The HOT BOX
          itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
          Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
          men lift the heavy iron door open.
          REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box
          dug into the ground.
          Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.

          WHEN ...
          Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
          Django watches this.
          DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
          BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.

          REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
          as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
          Stephen breaks the mood.

                         STEPHEN

                         (TO DJANGO)
          You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
          little box?
          Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
          Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.

          INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
          Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
          the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
          rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
          the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
          room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.

          INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
          A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
          pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
          lamp and a tiny bell on it.









                         105

                         STEPHEN
          This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
          nice too.
          Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
          Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
          rattles on in the background.

                         STEPHEN
          Feel free to touch anything you want,
          cause we burnin' all this shit once you
          gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
          door when the demonstration ready.
          Django sits down on the bed.
          Stephen turns to leave.

                         DJANGO
          Not so fast.

                         STEPHEN
          I got more important things to do then
          jaw with you.

                         DJANGO
          Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
          Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.

                         DJANGO
          This tiny bell on this little table...
          .is this for you? I ring this, you
          do fer me?

                         STEPHEN
          Me or somebody.
          Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
          (a soft) DING-A-LING

                         STEPHEN

                         (UNAMUSED)
          What 'cha want?

                         DJANGO
          I want you to pour some water in that
          bowl for my wash up.
          Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.









                         )O'
          Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
          Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.

                         DJANGO
          Gimmie.
          Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
          Django takes it from him.
          Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
          The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.

                         DJANGO
          Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
          that?
          Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
          knocking him to the floor;

                         DJANGO
          That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
           The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
          he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
          Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
          floor below his knees.

                         DJANGO
          I've known me House Niggers like you my
          whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
          Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
          then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
          rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
          all the white folks think it's so cute.
          Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
          here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
          good side. Well this time Snowball, you
          gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
          you wanna sling my way, before they give
          us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
          give this whole motherfuckin plantation
          a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
          off your ass. I will make you drop your
          drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
          Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
          every nigga on this plantation. And after
          I do that, let's see you play the rooster
          round here.









                         X07

                         STEPHEN
          Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.

                         DJANGO
          Oh that's right, he gives you first name
          privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
          me again nigger, see what happen'.
          Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.

                         DJANGO
          That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
          With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
          Before he leaves, Django tells him;,

                         DJANGO
          When I ring this bell, you better come
          a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
          I'm on this property, you my nigger
          Snowball.
          Stephen leaves.
          Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
          A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
          Schultz stands there.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Was that wise?
          Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.

                         DJANGO
          He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
          That's all that needs to be said.

          INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
           Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
          domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
          after Calvin's sister raps on it.
          Dr.Schultz opens the door.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Hello ladies.









                         DOG

                         LARA LEE
          Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
          Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
          speaks German.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO BROOMHILDA)
          I've been informed you do as well.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
          in German.
          Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Astonishing.

                         (IN GERMAN)
          Please come inside Fraulein.
          She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
          "Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
          to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.

          INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
          With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
          disoriented girl.
          He gives her a pleasant smile.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          They call you Hildi, but your real name
          is Broomhilda, isn't it?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes. How do you know that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Stands to reason who ever taught you
          German would also give you a German name.
          Can I pour you a glass of water,
          Broomhilda?
          Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
          to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
          on the frightened girl.









                         107

          WE CUT TO DJANGO
          on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
          to present himself.
          BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
          As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
          talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
          a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
          I'm only speaking German to you now,
          Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
          listening to us. Myself and a mutual
          friend of ours, have gone through a lot
          of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
          find you fraulein - to rescue you.
          He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
          She looks at him weird, rescue me?
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Please drink.
          She absentmindedly obeys.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

          (.GERMAN).
          Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
          intention to take you away from here
          forever.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          I don't got any friends.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Yes you do.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          Who?
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
          flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
          surprise you.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          Where is he?
          He points at the adjoining door.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Standing right behind that door.
          Her head moves in the direction of the door.
          He looks to the young woman;
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Promise me you won't scream?
          She nods her head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (GERMAN)
          Say, I promise.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (GERMAN)
          I promise.
          Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
          The door knob turns.
          The door slowly opens revealing...
           Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
          He smiles at her, and says;

                          DJANGO
           Hey Little Trouble Maker.
          Obviously a pet name between them.
          Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
           .first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
          the water spills on the floor ...
           .followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.









                         1/1
          The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You silver tongued devil you.

                         MONTAGE
          WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
          they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
          is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
          soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
          vaguely optimistic ...
          WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
          The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
          Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
          sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
          continues over this scene.
          Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
          Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
          the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
          The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
          for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
          A study in powerless fury.

          DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
          in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
          She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
          The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
          Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
          Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
          What you. whistlin', girl?
          Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.

                         STEPHEN
          What was you whistlin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Oh nuttin'.

                         STEPHEN
          You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
          whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
          no.name.









                         )/Z

                         STEPHEN
          It's kinder pretty.
          She doesn't say anything in return.

                         STEPHEN
          That was a compliment.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Thank you.
          Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.

                         STEPHEN
          I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
          such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
          run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
          Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
          The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
          you are two days later, whistlin' while you
          work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
          have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
          .I'm jus' sayin'.
          He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I'm done here, may I be excused?

                         STEPHEN
          Yes you may.
          She moves off to another part of the house.
          He watches her shuffle off.

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
          Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
          They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
          Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
          Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
          Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
          Domestic Slaves despise Django.
          Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
          though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
          We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.









          "5.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
          specimens, no doubt about it. But the
          best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
          and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
          called Eskimo Joe?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
          get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
          day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
          best, and you'll never sell him and I can
          see why, he's a champion.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          All three are champions.
          Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

                         DJANGO
          Samson's the champion. The other two
          are pretty good.
          All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
          contradict Calvin Candie.
          Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
          that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
          potatoes.

                         LARA LEE
          Hildi!
          Broomhilda snaps back.
          Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
          then issues his own appraisal;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
          take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
          best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
          long as you don't put 'em up against those
          two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

                         DJANGO
          Maybe.
          The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.









                         //

                         F
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
          admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
          game, I do have a bit of a background in
          the European traveling circus. Hence, I
          have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
          I need something more then just a big nigger.
          He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
          I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
          I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
          for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
          Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
          but is he right as rain ... ?
          Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
          sip of his mint julep, then says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
          is no one in the nigger fight game that
          appreciates the value of showmanship
          more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
          one must not forget the most important
          thing in the nigger fight game.

                         (BEAT)
          A nigger that can win fights. That should
          be your first, second, third, four, and
          fifth concern. After you have that, and
          you know you have that, then, you can
          start to implement a grande design. But
          since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
          status - beating Moguy by one year for
          that honor allow the old sage to advise,
          first things first.
          Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
          Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
          She smiles, and says something pleasant back.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I see you two gettin' on?
          Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          .Famously.

                         (DRAMATIC PAUSE)
          Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
          it's like not to hear you native tongue
          for four years.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.









                         ?»5
          Everybody at the table chuckles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I can't express the joy I felt conversing
          in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
          charming conversation companion.
          As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
          how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
          Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.

                         LARA LEE
          I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
          the German sweet talk you want, but it
          looks like this ponys got big eyes for
          Django.
          Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
          Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.

          AND ...
          .STEPHEN sees it.
          Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
          Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
          Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
          kitchen.
          Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
          mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
          a drink in this house in twenty years.

                         STEPHEN
          When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
          a COLD drink.
          Chuckle... . chuckle...

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Did you overhear that joke I said about
          me spending two weeks in Boston

                         STEPHEN

                         (MOCK INDIGNANT)
          You don't have any idea the work I do
          to see food gets on the table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What does that hafta do with the price of
          Tea in China?

                         STEPHEN
          You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
          nothin' better to do then listen in here
          to you tellin' unfunny jokes?
          Chuckle... . chuckle...

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (MOCK INDIGNATION)
          What? They laughed!

                         STEPHEN
          Of course they laughed, their parents
          raised them right. When they're a guest
          in somebody's house, and the master of
          of the house thinks he's- funny, you
          suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
          Chuckle... .chuckle...
          They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          No it was really funny,

                         (TO TABLE)
          wasn't it?

                         STEPHEN
          Now what do you expect these people to
          say? What you need to do is stop
          embarrassing your guest.

                         (TO TABLE)
          Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
          polite, I understand, you mean well, but
          it just encourages him.
          Chuckle-chuckle...
          As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.

          TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
          eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.

                         STEPHEN
          You know that nigger?
          /??? She spins around.

          No.

          You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
          She shakes her head, no.
          Stephen looks at her skeptical.

                         STEPHEN
          Okay, if you say so.

          BACK TO DINNER TABLE
          Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.

                         DJANGO
          Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
          about it. But if it was my money, I
          wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
          for him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What would your price be?

                         DJANGO
          Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
          and I don't know why I would be inclined
          to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
          Candie's lawyer chimes in.

                         MOGUY
          But the real question is, not how much
          he cost, but how much he can earn?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django?

                         DJANGO
          In a years time, seven or eight fights -
          outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
          pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...

          Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
          one thousand dollars.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
          you cut that cake, that spells profit.
          Not to, mention a years worth of action at
          the big table in a blood sport with a
          winner nigger. However let me reclarify
          how this whole negotiation came about.
          It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
          nigger, it was you who approached me to
          buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
          figure Bright Boy was banding about,
          ain't too far off from right. And if I
          wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
          could sell 'em any day of the week.
          But like you said in Greenville doctor,
          I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
          ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
          dollars that would make me consider it.
          Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
          the power of persuasion.
          Candie smiles at that remark.
          Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
          Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
          The White people at the table get very happy.
          Dr.Schultz continues;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          However, that is a tremendous amount of
          money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
          I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
          Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
          up a legal contract before I would feel
          comfortable exchanging that amount of
          money for flesh. Not to mention having
          Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
          choosing. So say I return in about five
          days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
          Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
          the finer points between themselves.

          Stephen, time for dessert!
          Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
          kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
          Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may, Hildi.
          She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
          Candie looks up at her as she works.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
          table in the big house?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's a lot better then sizzling in that
          hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
          bramble bush, ain't it?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes 'em.
          With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
          Stephen clocks this.
          Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

          You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
          be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
          back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
          where he from.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
          just speak German, or did ya git her
          clothes off?









          !20
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We just spoke.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So you haven't seen her back?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No I haven't.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then Stephen's right, you would probably
          find this interesting. Hildi, take off
          your dress, and show us your back.
          Django hears this.
          Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
          Stephen clocks it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
          and looking nice.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
          they don't got niggers there. And he's a
          man of medicine. I'm sure it would
          fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
          pain. I mean Hildi got something like
          fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
          one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
          are tough, no doubt about it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
          Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
          Django continues to watching this play out.
          Stephen watches him.
          Candie folds.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
          During the brandies.
          Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
          kitchen.
          Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
          the kitchen door.









                         121

          INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;

                         STEPHEN
          I thought you said you didn't know him?
          Broomhilda turns around.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Huh?
          Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

                         STEPHEN
          I said, you said, you didn't know him?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I don't.

                         STEPHEN
          Yes you do.

                         BROOMHILDA
          Mister Stephen, I don't.

                         STEPHEN
          Why you lyin to me?
          As tears begin to well in her eyes.

                         BROOMBILDA
          I ain't.

                         STEPHEN
          Why you cryin'?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Because you're scarin' me.

                         STEPHEN
          Why am I scarin' you?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Because you're scary.
          Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
          table conversation begins to bleed inside.
          We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
          Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
          .to speak German,with Hildi this
          afternoon was positively soul enriching.
          Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.









                         1ZL
          His eyes to to Broomhilda.

                         STEPHEN
          You, stay in the kitchen.
          Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
          Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
          these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's
          just figured it out.

          INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You indicated earlier you would be
          willing to part with Hildi?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes siree bob I did.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well in that case allow me to propose
          another proposition?
          In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
          INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.

                         STEPHEN
          - Monsieur Candie?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.

                         STEPHEN
          (to Dr.Schultz)
          Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
          ain't worth a damn these days.

                         (TO CANDIE)
          Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
          the kitchen.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What, you mean get outta my chair?

                         STEPHEN
          If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What about dessert?

                         STEPHEN
          I would rather tell you in private.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
          melodrama could be brewing back there?









                         123
          Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;

                         STEPHEN
          Meet me in the library.
          Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
          has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
          library" is their secret signal.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
          Stephen exits.
          Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
          they are in the kitchen, from time to
          time, adult supervision is required.
          If you'll excuse me a moment.
          Candie exits.

          TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
          books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on
          the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
          When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
          leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
          Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
          brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
          Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
          outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
          dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
          turkey.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What's the matter?

                         STEPHEN
          Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
          mandingos. They want that girl. -

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What the hell you talkin' about?

                         STEPHEN
          They playin your ass for a fool, that's
          what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
          for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
          that girl.









                         CALVIN CANDIE
          What girl, Hildi?

                         STEPHEN
          Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          He just bought Eskimo Joe.

                         STEPHEN
          Did he give you any money?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Well not yet, but -

                         STEPHEN
          - Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
          how. But he was just about to buy, who he
          came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
          Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
          go through all that trouble, to. buy a
          nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
          five hundred dollars?

                         STEPHEN
          Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
          love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
          Now why that German gives a fuck about
          who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
          with, I'm sure I don't know.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          If she's who they want, why the whole
          snake oil pitch about mandingos?

                         STEPHEN
          Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
          to four hundred dollar. But twelve
          thousand got you real friendly.
          Calvin thinks ...
          .as per usual, Stephen's right.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
          sonsabitches!

                         (LOUDER)
          Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
          fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
          .gonna have us a Candyland tar and
          feathering!









                         FL5

                         STEPHEN
          Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
          seein' something like that ... . but why
          don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
          huckster insinuate themselves at my
          dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
          plantation for a fool!

                         STEPHEN
          Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
          discuss this.
          A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.

                         STEPHEN
          Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
          was something up with these two. We just
          didn't know what. But now we do. They
          don't want you to know how bad they want
          that girl. But these ole boys have rode
          a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
          trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
          bull to get this girl. They must want her
          mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
          changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
          wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
          changed is the advantage.

                         (BEAT)
          Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
          and busts these motherfucker's chops.

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
           The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
          melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
          kitchen door.
          Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon

                         SEEING HIM;

                         LARA LEE
          There you are! I was beginning to think
          you and that of crow ran off together.
          Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
          stares down the table at them.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
          Lara Lee?

                         (CON'T)









                         1Z J

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (CON'T)
          Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
          Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
          shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
          Would you be a dear and go out there and
          give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
          knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
          But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
          Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
          Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
          Django.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
          your shoulder?
          Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
          pointing at them.
          Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
          he's holding a big ugly hammer.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
          They put their palms on the table.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now you lift those palms off that turtle
          shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
          loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
          There's been a lotta lies said around this
          table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.

                         (BEAT)
          Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
          the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
          Mr.Moguy does.
          Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
          were just getting ready to make me a
          proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Right.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (YELLING TO

                         STEPHEN)
          Stephen! Bring out Hildi!








          Ix?
          Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
          roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
          against the side of her head.
          Django and Schultz react.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now it should be quite clear by now I know
          you're not here to buy no mandingos.
          Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
          want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
          to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
          you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
          horseshit.

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Stephen, put her in that chair.
          Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
          With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
          silently watch Candie's next move.
          Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
          You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
          sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
          Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
          Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
          consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
          myself said, "What is your definition of
          ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
          thousand dollars."
          Now considering you two have ridden a whole
          lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
          and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
          purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
          appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
          And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
          Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I take it you prefer the take it or leave
          it style of negotiating.
          Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
          Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
          anything with my property I so desire.
          He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
          everybody jump.









                         IN

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          And if you think my price for this nigger
          is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
          is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
          death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
          He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
          this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I lift my hands from the table top in
          order to remove my billfold?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
          jacket, and says;,
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Easy come, easy go.
          He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
          takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
          the seated Schultz, and says;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Pleasure doin' business with you.

                         TIME CUT

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
          .Moguy signs as a witness.
          Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
          freedom papers.
          Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
          All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
          Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
          Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
          For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
          thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
          runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
          dollars- for twelve thousand.








          Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
          The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
          around pouring coffee for the white people.
          Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
          rhubarb pie with him.

                         CALVIN CANDIE

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          Rhubarb pie?
          Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
          of ya?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Actually, I was thinking of that poor
          devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
          And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
          all this.
          Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
          bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
          examines he papers.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Dumas...?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
          I figured you must be an admirer. You named
          your slave after that novel's lead character.
          If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
          wonder what he would of made of it?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You doubt he'd approve?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
          at best.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Soft hearted Frenchy?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas is black.









                         1 30
          Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
          companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We got it, let's go.

                         (TO CANDIE)
          Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
          auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
          actually means is, till I see you again,
          and since I never wish to see you again,
          to you sir, I say, goodbye.
          Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
          When Calvin says to the German's back;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          One more moment, Doc!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's a custom here in the South, once a
          business deal is concluded, for the two
          parties to shake hands. It implies good
          faith.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm not from the South.
          He turns to leave.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
          I must insist.
          This turns Schultz around.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Insist what...? That I shake your hand
          before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
          insist in the opposite direction.
          Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          You know what I think you are?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What you think I am? No I don't.









          1310,

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          I think you are a bad loser.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And I think you're an abysmal winner.

                         CALVIN CANDLE
          Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
          a deal ain't done till the two parties have
          shook hands. Even after all this paper
          signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
          away twelve thousand dollars...?
          I don't think so.
          Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Let's go.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
          before this German shakes my hand.
          Cut 'er down.
          Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
          .and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks

                         CANDLE;
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          You really want me to shake your hand?
          Django gets it.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          I insist.

                         DR
          -Schultz smiles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, if you insist.
          Django goes to stop him...









                         1 714
          The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
          Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
          The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

          POP!
          He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
          Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
          falls to the floor.
          Everybody is stunned.
          Schultz looks to Django.
          Django looks back.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO DJANGO)
          I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
          Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
          The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

          FADE TO BLACK








          We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
          The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
          it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
          The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
          are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
          whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
          three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

          INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
          Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
          with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
          Django begins to come to ...

                         TIMMY

                         (SHHH'S HIM)
          Act like you still sleepin'.

                         DJANGO
          Where's Broomhilda?

                         TIMMY
          Who?

                         DJANGO
          Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
          couple of days ago. They had her in The
          Hot Box.

                         TIMMY
          I don't know 'bout no girl.

                         DJANGO
          How 'bout that German white man I came
          here with?

                         TIMMY
          Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
          Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
          friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
          the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
          Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
          Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
          bucket at the fleeing boy.

                         ACE WOODY
          Git on outta here, boy!









                         133
          Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
          at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
          makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

                         ACE WOODY
          So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
          Django thinks, "How does he know?"

                         ACE WOODY
          I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
          We found your wanted posters and book of figures
          in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
          heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
          boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
          line of work?
          Django retorts, upside down.

                         DJANGO
          Well, it turns out I was a natural.
          Ace woody laughs.

                         ACE WOODY
          Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
          Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
          length from the hanging man.

                         ACE WOODY
          See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
          'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
          everyone 'round here blames you.
          Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
          gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
          shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

                         ACE WOODY
          Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
          goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
          hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
          However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
          able to attend.
          Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
          . IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
          Django's face.
          Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
          the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
          the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
          As he does this, he says;









                         ACE WOODY
          Now I understand you didn't really have
          nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
          sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
          to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
          asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
          But grieving folks 'round here need someone
          to blame. And I guess they figure if you
          hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
          in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
          And you know what, they got a point.
          He THROWS the knife again...
          .this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
          He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
          As he does he says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
          the error of his ways, believe me when I.
          tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
          book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
          there try an' git creative with the way they
          bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
          methods are, tried and true.
          He THROWS the knife again...
          Django JERKS his head back ...
          .and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
          Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
          wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
          naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
          mercy.

                         ACE WOODY
          You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
          me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
          training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
          money I made my whole goddamn life.
          And no end in sight, neither.

                         (BEAT)
          Then you came along. Knocked me right off
          that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
          Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
          mandingos as her brother?
          Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
          is you done fucked up my good thang.
          So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
          could say I gotta axe to grind.









                         IJS
          He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
          Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
          Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.

                         ACE WOODY
          How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
          your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
          the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
          Django dances some more ...

                         ACE WOODY
          Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.

                         (BREATH)
          On the count of three.

                         DJANGO SCREAMS:

                         DJANGO

          NO!!!!

                         ACE WOODY

          ONE ...

                         DJANGO

          NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!

                         ACE WOODY
          Got to do it, boy. TWO...

                         DJANGO

          NO!!!! !
          Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
          facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.

                         STEPHEN
          Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
          talk about the Old Man's funeral.
          Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
          Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
          Dickey people.
          While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;

                         ACE WOODY
          Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
          Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
          of what almost happened.

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO DJANGO)
          How disappointing.









                         171

                         ACE WOODY

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Where she at?

                         STEPHEN
          She in the big house. The kitchen.
          Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
          blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
          the fire.
          Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.

                         ACE WOODY
          You gonna look after our friend?
          As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;

                         STEPHEN
          Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
          01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
          upside down nigger we both know, gonna
          have us a big of chat.
          He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END

          GLOWS ORANGE.

                         STEPHEN
          Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
          stick is all nice and FROSTY.
          Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
          Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
          alone.
          With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
          hanging Django.

                         STEPHEN
          I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
          on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
          Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
          You get the idea to go to Greenville -
          look up the Ole Man there.

                         (BREATH)
          That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
          believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
          buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
          to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
          whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
          Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
          goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
          Big House.









                         137

                         STEPHEN

                         (BEAT)
          And that's where you met me. And that's when
          you knew your goose was cooked.
          He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
          Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
          stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
          fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
          tip of that red hot poker.

                         STEPHEN
          Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
          didn't know what's what. He still thought his
          ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
          you are, you always know the end is near
          'fore the white folks.
          With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
          The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
          breathing it in his nostrils.

                         STEPHEN
          Damn Nigger, you smell good.
          He walks behind Django with the poker.

                         STEPHEN
          You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
          bed in the quest room in the Big House -
          After you slapped my ass to the floor
          You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
          ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
          Remember that, Bright Boy?
          He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
          buttocks.
          Django SCREAMS!
          Stephen LAUGHS.
          Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
          through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
          the floor by the hanging man.

                         STEPHEN
          You leavin', that's what you can take
          with you.
          Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
          him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.

                         STEPHEN
          Now you were quite the topic of conversation
          for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
          never had a bright idea in their life, was
          comin' up with different ways to kill your
          ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
          wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
          like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
          niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
          "Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
          Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
          "Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
          mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
          And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
          We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
          the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
          worse then that."
          He stops massaging Django's balls.

                         STEPHEN
          So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
          your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
          And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
          you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
          every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
          And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
          'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
          the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
          Like them three y'all came back with. For them
          big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
          'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
          I give two or three.
          Stephen turns to leave.

                         DJANGO
          Where's Broomhilda?

                         STEPHEN
          She's all right for now. Miss Lara
          soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
          to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
          Now Billy Crash might not look or
          smell too good, but ain't nobody
          gonna bother her.
          Stephen limps away.

          EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
          The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
          up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
          prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
          2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
          trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
          a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
          The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
          stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

                         ROY
          It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
          the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
          git out.
          The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
          Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
          and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
          bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
          wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
          The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

                         FLOYD
          You blacks line up.
          They do.

                         FLOYD
          What's your names?

                         CHESTER
          Chester.

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          Chicken Charly.

                         RODNEY
          Rodney.

                         FLOYD
          I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.

                         (POINTING AT

                         CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
          What's that?

                         CHESTER
          It's my stuff.

                         FLOYD
          Throw it in the dirt.









                         1 40
          All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
          off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
          corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.

                         FLOYD
          (to Chicken Charly)
          You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
          (to all three)
          You are now the property of The LeQuint
          Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
          This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
          the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
          Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
          Woody call out;

          ACE WOODY (OS)
          Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
          for ya.
          Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
          barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his
          old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.

                         ROY
          We can't use that skinny bastard.

                         ACE WOODY
          We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
          punishment niggers from time to time.

                         ROY
          No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
          confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.

                         ROY
          Look, no one tole' me 'bout -

                         ACE WOODY
          - No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
          Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
          Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
          wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
          how and why you fucked up our nice little
          business relationship, take this nigger and
          hush up about it!

                         ROY
          Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.









                         "H
          Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
          Django stops Ace Woody.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
          with them. They'll kill me. What about all
          that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
          shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
          the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
          them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
          I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
          but I didn't think that was the idea.
          Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.

                         ACE WOODY
          He can't go in there with them.

                         FLOYD
          Why not?

                         ACE WOODY
          They'll kill him.

                         FLOYD
          I don't give a damn.

                         ACE WOODY
          Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
          we want the mine to grind him to gravel!

                         ROY
          Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
          black and make sure he keeps up.

                         JANO
          Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
          Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end
          around his saddle horn.
          The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.

          EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County.
          Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon, Rodney,

          Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
          Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
          He hands it to Jano.

          EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK
          The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
          the side of the road.

          IN THE CAGE
          Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through
          the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
          what they're watching.
          What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
          company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
          hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
          includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
          piece of paper.

          INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
          Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.

                         DJANGO
          I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
          a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
          Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
          Candyland on a horse with my white German
          partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
          Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
          Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
          Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
          went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
          Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
          blame me, so here I am.

                         (TO ROY)
          You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
          know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
          But those four men, are still back there.
          They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
          five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
          last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
          and gittin it.
          Django is damn convincing.

                         ROY
          What's your deal? You tell us who they are
          and we let ya go?

                         DJANGO
          I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
          me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
          dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
          and I'll point 'em out to you.
          He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
          one little push.









                         1Q7

                         DJANGO
          Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
          truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
          me in the same cage with them without them
          killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
          .am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
          there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

                         CUT TO

          ROY AND FLOYD
          go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
          Roy continues to study the handbill.

                         ROY

                         (READING ALOUD)
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
          The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
          robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
          One thousand five hundred dollars for each
          of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

                         FLOYD
          Just because the handbill's real doesn't
          mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

                         ROY
          Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
          or alive handbill in his pocket?
          Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.

                         ROY
          That black's damn convincing.
          They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;

                         ROY
          (pointing, behind
          him, at Django)
          That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
          The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
          Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
          the barrel at the cage.

                         ROY
          I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
          like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
          he ride in with a white man yesterday?









                         CHESTER
          Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
          Auction and he rode on a horse with a
          white man.

                         ROY
          This white man, was the black his slave?

                         RODNEY
          He weren't no slave.

                         FLOYD
          You sure about that?

                         RODNEY
          Damn sure.
          Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
          seriously.

                         ROY
          What happened at Candyland?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

                         ROY
          Who shot 'em?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          The German.

                         ROY
          And why did he do that?

                         CHICKEN CHARLY
          The nigger and the German were actin as if they
          were slavers, but they weren't.

                         ROY
          What were they?

                         RODNEY
          Bounty hunters.
          Floyd is starting to get convinced.

                         FLOYD
          Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
          (to the Slaves)
          Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?









          !Y,

                         ROY
          (barking at Floyd)
          They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
          you idiot!

                         CUT TO
          Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.

                         ROY
          Okay black, you gotta deal.
          Jano reacts.

                         DJANGO
          I got one more condition.

                         ROY
          What?

                         DJANGO
          When we get there, when the time comes,
          you let me help you kill 'em.
          Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.

                         ROY

                         (LAUGHING)
          You got a deal, black.
          Django interrupts -

                         DJANGO
          You gotta deal, mate.
          Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.

                         ROY
          You're all right for a black fella!

                         THE CAGE
          Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
          cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
          all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"

          BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

                         ROY
          We'll give you that pack horse.

                         DJANGO
          What's them saddle bags filled with?

                         FLOYD
          Dynamite.








          !so

                         DJANGO
          I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
          dynamite on his back!

                         ROY

                         (CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
          Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
          off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
          cage.
           Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
           the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
           and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
          at all.
          Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
          horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
          Cage Wagon.
          Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;

                         DJANGO
          Where's my pistol?

                         ROY
          Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
          'em your gun and your belt.
          Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
          to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
          About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;

                         FLOYD
          Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
          fixed last month, it's perfect.
          Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.

                         DJANGO
          That's good to know.
          Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
          in the chest...
          Roy turns around...
          Django takes the gun out of the holster...
          . BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
          dead.
          Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
          Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!








          Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
          The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
          The CAGE WAGON
          Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
          blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
          the air, obscuring all visibility...

          THEN ...
          A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
          REVEALING in bright color focus...
          .DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
          Jano.
          He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
          wrapped around his waist.
          He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
          He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
          and climbs aboard him bareback.
          He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
          next to him.
          Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
          beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
          now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
          horses bring the best out of Django.
          From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

          .THEN...
          Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
          cage door.
          He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

                         DJANGO
          Throw up that dynamite.
          Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
          his Horse.
          Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
          without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
          The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.
          "Who was that nigger?"

          Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on
          'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
          A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
          Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
          Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
          mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
          The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress,
          wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora)
          crying at her side.

                         CORA
          The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
          Candie think it real nice.

                         LARA LEE
          Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.

          WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
          of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
          backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one
          hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a
          gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.

          The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse
          wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
          mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of
          your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"
          (yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice
          that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
          Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small

          head...

                         SHIRTLESS DJANGO
          moves quietly through the woods.

                         MARSHA
          rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three
          PALS continue to lay out.

          DJANGO BY A TREE
          he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the
          chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.

                         MARSHA

          BARK!
          The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
          Django disappears.

          INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
          They hear the barking inside.
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Jake!
          Jake building his birdhouse.

                         JAKE
          Yeah?
          Mr.STONESIPHER
          Check on Marsha.
          Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to
          check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK
          As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
          chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

                         JAKE
          opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of
          him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...

          DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...

          JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.








          After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
          Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
          has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
          And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
          till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
          and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
          But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
          able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
          knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
          attack.
          Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
          The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
          The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
          just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
          physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
          not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
          to take Stonesipher's ass out.
          This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
          all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
          each other for their life.
          Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
          mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
          holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
          opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
          the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

          STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
          That weakens Stonesipher.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
          That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
          That puts the mountain man down on his back.
          He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
          The Trackers are all dead.
          Only the dogs mad barking remains.
          EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
          The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway. The Preacher reads some
          words over him.









          EXT - TRACKER SHACK - NIGHT
          Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps
          out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks
          over to the WATER PUMP.
          Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
          He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
          begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says outloud;

                         DJANGO
          Wanna help me out?

                         TIMMY
          Sure.

                         DJANGO
          My woman, Hildi, is with Billy Crash.
          You know where his shack is?

                         TIMMY
          Sure do.

                         DJANGO
          You show me?

                         TIMMY
          Will I get in trouble?

                         DJANGO
          Not by the time I get through killin'
          everybody.
          Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes him.

                         TIMMY
          I'll show ya.

          THEN ...
          Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and asks;

                         DJANGO
          You know what toadstools look like?









                         15-C

                         TIMMY
          Sure do.

                         DJANGO
          Go pick me a mess of 'em.
          INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS).
          INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden spoon in
          the tracker shack.
          Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
          Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
          the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
          He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
          mixes it up with the spoon.

          EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
          Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
          It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
          The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
          the stew.
          Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

                         DJANGO
          You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
          Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

                         DJANGO
          First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.

          EXT - FUNERAL NIGHT
          The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.

          TNT - STABLE-BLACKSMITH - NIGHT
          Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
          straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
          see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
          He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
          And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

                         DJANGO
          Saddle up Fritz and Tony.








          Timmy just stares.

                         DJANGO
          Now, boy!
          Timmy hops to work.
          Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
          bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
          searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
          holster around his ankle.
          As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

                         TIMMY
          Do you feel bad for your friend?
          Django rises from the body of his friend.

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, "I do.
          As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

                         TIMMY
          I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
          friend once. He drowned in the lake.
          Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
          friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
          understand.
          He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
          furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
          And finally his hat.
          EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
          The service is over, everybody is hugging each other and holding hands,
          and beginning to leave.

          INT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
          Billy Crash is in bed fucking Broomhilda. She doesn't wail, she doesn't
          make any whimpering sounds, but her eyes constantly water.
          As Billy's fucking her he says;

                         BILLY CRASH
          It's gonna be real nice 'round here now
          the 'ol man's gone.

                         (CON'T)









                         'SR

                         BILLY CRASH

                         (FUCKS)
          Would you stop your galdarn cryin'!
          He stops fucking in frustration

                         BROOMHILDA
          I can't.

                         BILLY CRASH
          Now girl, I'm tryin' to be nice.

                         BROOMHILDA
          I can't help it! I'm really sad!
          He hops off her and yells at her.

                         BILLY CRASH
          Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad
          for niggers! Git use to it!

                         (CALMING DOWN)
          Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster
          from way back. But you know I've always been
          sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass.
          So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit.
          You calm down.
          He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
          WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for
          Django, she cries for herself...

          .THEN...
          She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
          And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy
          Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
          Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the
          front door.

                         CU BROOMHILDA
          Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
          A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.

                         BROOMHILDA

                         (SOFTLY)
          Yes?
          The VOICE on the other side of the door, says;

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          Hey Little Trouble Maker.









                         157
          She hops out of bed, and throws open the door...

          THERE HE IS,
          she runs into his arms.
          EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
          The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of
          dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin.
          The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The
          funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the
          overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher.
          The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying
          goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to
          them.
          A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the
          hill back to the big house.

          EXT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
          Django with Broomhilda. Billy Crash lies dead in the B.G., Stonesipher's
          Buck Knife buried deep in his chest. He hands Broomhilda her papers.

                         DJANGO
          Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers.
          No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
          and get out of the south.

                         BROOMHILDA
          What's gonna happen to you?

                         DJANGO
          Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey,
          I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little
          Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is
          named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me
          around the side of the big house.

                         BROOMHILDA
          But what about you -

                         DJANGO
          - Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with
          Timmy and the horses, by the big house.
          He sends her on her way.
          Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking
          down hill heading back for the big house.









                         (60
          EXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
          The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk
          back to The Big House for a drink. This Candie Family Unit consists of:
          LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress.
          CORA (unarmed) her mammy, walks with Miss Lara, holding her hand.
          STEPHEN. (unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his
          normal House Nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress
          Miss Lara, holding her other hand.
          ACE WOODY (armed with a gun belt.around his hip) dressed in his Wyatt
          Earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself.
          LEONIDE MOGUY (armed with a gun belt around his hip) walks by himself.
          BARTHOLOMEW (unarmed) dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with
          his hat, walks alone.
          BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY (both armed with guns on their hips) both
          dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together.
          and finally,
          SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos,
          wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew..
          This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral
          drinks.
          They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front
          door.
          Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the
          property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in
          their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House.
          The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking
          their way.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          moves closer towards the front of The Big House...

          WHEN ...
          The front of The Big House

          EXPLODES!
          knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses.
          BROOMHILDA and TIMMY
          can't believe their eyes.









                         I6 I

          WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER
          hang in the air.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
          hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
          As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
          up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
          The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
          mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
          CUE cool MUSIC.
          STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
          ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
          BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
          In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
          ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
          MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
          CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
          The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
          ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
          around his waist.
          Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
          .it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
          ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
          The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO

          OUTFIT.
          STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
          JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's
          standing there.
          He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down
          at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester
          rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by
          the gun on his hip.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of
          Wonder, Fear, and Hate.









                         ICZ

          WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
          as she watches this.
          As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big
          House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
          The black man in the cool green jacket says;

                         DJANGO
          I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
          You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
          niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?

                         ACE WOODY
          I guess I shoulda'.

                         DJANGO
          Yes you should of.
          He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.

                         DJANGO
          Everybody stand up!
          It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
          Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
          Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.

          THEN...
          He tosses the rifle away.
          Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a

          SHOWDOWN STANCE.
          EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
          Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
          DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps
          at the ten people, and says;

                         DJANGO
          All black folks, take ten steps away from
          the white folks.
          DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.

                         DJANGO
          Not you Stephen. You're right where you
          belong.









                         163
          The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten
          steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
          LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
          CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
          DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of
          his pocket.

                         DJANGO

                         (TO STEPHEN)
          Let's see if you can handle this as well
          as you can my nuts?
          He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.

                         DJANGO

                         (TO EVERYBODY)
          Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
          BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.

                         BROWN

                         (TO DJANGO)
          Can I at least cock it for her?

                         DJANGO
          Yep.
          BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her hand,
          and points it towards the ground.

                         BROWN
          (to Lara Lee)
          Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till
          the shootin' starts. Then bring it up as
          fast as you can.
          LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in the
          middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to
          happen.

                         DJANGO
          (to the six)
          Make your play hillbillies.
          The MUSIC SWELLS.









                         16'F
          EVERYBODY, except for LARA LEE is READY:

          DJANGO ACE WOODY

                         STEPHEN MOGUY

                         BROWN CODY

          The PEOPLE watching on the side:

          BARTHOLOMEW SAMSON BROOMHILDA

          CORA GOLDIE TIMMY
          EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...

          TILL...
          ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
          to raise his Derringer.
          But it's no contest.
          As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
          Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
          FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
          Stephen) standing in front of him.
          They all fall to grass in different ways..
          It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
          HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

                         FLASH ON
          DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP
          to Dr.Schultz.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (SMILING)
          You know what they're going to call you,
          my boy? "The fastest gun in the South."

          BACK TO SHOWDOWN
          DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
          down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
          Candyland front lawn.
          The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.









                         /65
          All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
          alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
          DJANGO sees this.
          The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
          He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
          He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
          It EXPLODES.
          Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
          blowing the limbs off of many of them.
          The LAWN is SILENT.
          DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
          Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
          satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
          He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
          putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
          wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
          As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

                         DJANGO
          Hey Little Trouble Maker.

                         BROOMHILDA

          Timmy hops off of Tony.
          Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

          Django looks down to Timmy.

                         DJANGO
          Thanks for the help, boy.
          He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
          down to Timmy.

                         DJANGO
          That's for you. Good luck Tim.
          (he points to
          the Northern Sky)
          The North star, is that one.
          He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

                         BROOMHILDA

          They kiss.
          Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
          Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
          Dragons.



When Zarathustra was thirty years old he left his home and the lake of
his home and went into the mountains. Here he enjoyed his spirit and
his solitude and for ten years he did not tire of it. But at last his heart
transformed, — one morning he arose with the dawn, stepped before the
sun and spoke thus to it:

“You great star! What would your happiness be if you had not those
for whom you shine?

For ten years you have come up here to my cave: you would have tired
of your light and of this route without me, my eagle and my snake.

But we awaited you every morning, took your overﬂow from you and
blessed you for it.

Behold! I am weary of my wisdom, like a bee that has gathered too
much honey. I need hands that reach out.

I want to bestow and distribute until the wise among human beings
have once again enjoyed their folly, and the poor once again their wealth.

For this I must descend into the depths, as you do evenings when you
go behind the sea and bring light even to the underworld, you super—rich
star!

Like you, I must go tlowhI as the human beings say, to whom I want to
descend.

So bless me now, you quiet eye that can look upon even an all too great
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that wants to ﬂow over, such that water ﬂows golden from
it and everywhere carries the reﬂection of your bliss!

Behold! This cup wants to become empty again, and Zarathustra wants
to become human again.”

— Thus began Zarathustra's going under.

1 German uses urttergehert, literally “to go under” for the expression the sun “goes down.” Nietzsche
throughout Zarathustra uses wordplay to signify that Zarathustra‘s “going under” is a “going over”
or transition, u'hergehert, from human to superhuman, from man to overman. After Zarathustra
draws his ﬁrst analogy between himself and the sun, I use “going under” for urttergehert and its
noun form Urttergartg. In setting or going down the sun marks a transition. Zarathustra meanwhile
has been higher than human in both ﬁgurative and literal terms, and so his “going under” has the
effect of him transitioning to human again. However, on the ecumenical level, when human beings
transition or go under, and when they “overcome” the human, they should achieve the superhuman

(overman).

Thus S polee Zara thustra

Zarathustra climbed down alone from the mountains and encountered no
one. But when he came to the woods suddenly an old man stood before
him, who had left his saintly hut in search of roots in the woods. And thus
spoke the old man to Zarathustra:

“This wanderer is no stranger to me: many years ago he passed by here.
Zarathustra he was called; but he is transformed.

Back then you carried your ashes to the mountain: would you now carry
your ﬁre into the valley? Do you not fear the arsonist's punishment?

Yes, I recognize Zarathustra. His eyes are pure, and no disgust is Visible
around his mouth. Does he not stride like a dancer?

Zarathustra is transformed, Zarathustra has become a child, an
awakened one is Zarathustra. What do you want now among the
sleepers?

You lived in your solitude as if in the sea, and the sea carried you. Alas,
you want to climb ashore? Alas, you want to drag your own body again?”

Zarathustra answered: “I love mankind.”2

“Why,” asked the saint, “did I go into the woods and the wilder—
ness in the ﬁrst place? Was it not because I loved mankind all too
much?

Now I love God: human beings I do not love. Human beings are too
imperfect a thing for me. Love for human beings would kill me.”

Zarathustra replied. “Why did I speak of love? I bring mankind a gift.”

“Give them nothing,” said the saint. “Rather take something off them
and help them to carry it — that will do them the most good, if only it does
you good!

And if you want to give to them, then give nothing more than alms,
and make them beg for that too!”

“No,” answered Zarathustra. “I do not give alms. For that I am not
poor enough.”

The saint laughed at Zarathustra and spoke thus: “Then see to it that
they accept your treasures! They are mistrustful of hermits and do not
believe that we come to give gifts.

2 “Ich liebe die Menschen” means literally “I love human beings.” Earlier translators ignored the
ecological framework in which Nietzsche wrote Zarathustra by using expressions like “man.” The
prologue establishes a prevailing semantic ﬁeld, a framework in which human beings, animals,
nature and earth interact or should interact as never before.

To them our footsteps sound too lonely in the lanes. And if at night
lying in their beds they hear a man walking outside, long before the sun
rises, they probably ask themselves: where is the thief going?

Do not go to mankind and stay in the woods! Go even to the animals
instead! Why do you not want to be like me — a bear among bears, a bird
among birds?”

“And what does the saint do in the woods?” asked Zarathustra.

The saint answered: “I make songs and sing them, and when I make
songs I laugh, weep and growl: thus I praise God.

With singing, weeping, laughing and growling I praise the god who is
my god. But tell me, what do you bring us as a gift?”

When Zarathustra had heard these words he took his leave of the saint
and spoke: “What would I have to give you! But let me leave quickly before
I take something from you!” — And so they parted, the oldster and the
man, laughing like two boys laugh.

But when Zarathustra was alone he spoke thus to his heart: “Could it
be possible! This old saint in his woods has not yet heard the news that
God is dead!” —

When Zarathustra came into the nearest town lying on the edge of the
forest, he found many people gathered in the market place, for it had been
promised that a tightrope walker would perform. And Zarathustra spoke
thus to the people:

“I teach you the 0vermau.3 Human being is something that must be
overcome. What have you done to overcome him?

All creatures so far created something beyond themselves; and you
want to be the ebb of this great ﬂood and would even rather go back to
animals than overcome humans?

3 “Ich lehre euch den Ubermenschen.” Just as Mensch means human, human being, Uhermertsch
means superhuman, which I render throughout as overman, though I use human being, mankind,
people, and humanity to avoid the gendered and outmoded use of “man.” Two things are achieved
by using this combination. First, using “human being” and other species—indicating expressions
makes it clear that Nietzsche is concerned ecumenically with humans as a species, not merely with
males. Secondly, expanding beyond the use of “man” puts humans in an ecological context; for
Zarathustra to claim that “the overman shall be the meaning of the earth” is to argue for a new
relationship between humans and nature, between humans and the earth. Overman is preferred
to superhuman for two basic reasons; ﬁrst, it preserves the word play Nietzsche intends with his
constant references to going under and going over, and secondly, the comic book associations called
to mind by “superman” and super—heroes generally tend to reﬂect negatively, and frivolously, on
the term superhuman.

Thus S polee Zara thustra



What is the ape to a human? A laughing stock or a painful embarrass—
ment. And that is precisely what the human shall be to the overman: a
laughing stock or a painful embarrassment.

You have made your way from worm to human, and much in you is
still worm. Once you were apes, and even now a human is still more ape
than any ape.

But whoever is wisest among you is also just a conﬂict and a cross
between plant and ghost. But do I implore you to become ghosts or plants?

Behold, I teach you the overman!

The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman
shall he the meaning of the earth!

I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth and do not
believe those who speak to you of extraterrestrial hopes! They are mixers
of poisons whether they know it or not.

They are despisers of life, dying off and self—poisoned, of whom the
earth is weary: so let them fade away!

Once the sacrilege against God was the greatest sacrilege, but God
died, and then all these desecrators died. Now to desecrate the earth is
the most terrible thing, and to esteem the bowels of the unfathomable
higher than the meaning of the earth!

Once the soul gazed contemptuously at the body, and then such con—
tempt was the highest thing: it wanted the body gaunt, ghastly, starved.
Thus it intended to escape the body and the earth.

Oh this soul was gaunt, ghastly and starved, and cruelty was the lust
of this soul!

But you, too, my brothers, tell me: what does your body proclaim
about your soul? Is your soul not poverty and ﬁlth and a pitiful content—
ment?

Truly, mankind is a polluted stream. One has to be a sea to take in a
polluted stream without becoming unclean.

Behold, I teach you the overman: he is this sea, in him your great
contempt can go under.

What is the greatest thing that you can experience? It is the hour of
your great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness turns to
nausea and likewise your reason and your Virtue.

The hour in which you say: ‘What matters my happiness? It is poverty
and ﬁlth, and a pitiful contentment. But my happiness ought to justify
existence itselﬂ'

F irst Part



The hour in which you say: ‘What matters my reason? Does it crave
knowledge like the lion its food? It is poverty and ﬁlth and a pitiful
contentment!'

The hour in which you say: ‘What matters my virtue? It has not yet
made me rage. How weary I am of my good and my evil! That is all poverty
and ﬁlth and a pitiful contentment!'

The hour in which you say: ‘What matters my justice? I do not see that
I am ember and coal. But the just person is ember and coal!'

The hour in which you say: ‘What matters my pity? Is pity not the cross
on which he is nailed who loves humans? But my pity is no cruciﬁxion.'

Have you yet spoken thus? Have you yet cried out thus? Oh that I might
have heard you cry out thus!

Not your sin — your modesty cries out to high heaven, your stinginess
even in sinning cries out to high heaven!

Where is the lightning that would lick you with its tongue? Where is
the madness with which you should be inoculated?

Behold, I teach you the overman: he is this lightning, he is this
madness! 7”

When Zarathustra had spoken thus someone from the crowd cried out:

“We have heard enough already about the tightrope walker, now let us
see him too!” And all the people laughed at Zarathustra. But the tightrope
walker, believing that these words concerned him, got down to his work.

4

Now Zarathustra looked at the people and he was amazed. Then he spoke
thus:

“Mankind is a rope fastened between animal and overman — a rope over
an abyss.

A dangerous crossing, a dangerous on—the—way, a dangerous looking
back, a dangerous shuddering and standing still.

What is great about human beings is that they are a bridge and not a
purpose: what is lovable about human beings is that they are a crossing
over and a going uhhler.

I love those who do not know how to live unless by going under, for
they are the ones who cross over.

I love the great despisers, because they are the great venerators and
arrows of longing for the other shore.

7

Thus S polee Zara thustra



I love those who do not ﬁrst seek behind the stars for a reason to go
under and be a sacriﬁce, who instead sacriﬁce themselves for the earth, so
that the earth may one day become the overman's.

I love the one who lives in order to know, and who wants to know so
that one day the overman may live. And so he wants his going under.

I love the one who works and invents in order to build a house for the
overman and to prepare earth, animals and plants for him: for thus he
wants his going under.

I love the one who loves his virtue: for virtue is the will to going under
and an arrow of longing.

I love the one who does not hold back a single drop of spirit for himself,
but wants instead to be entirely the spirit of his virtue: thus he strides as
spirit over the bridge.

I love the one who makes of his virtue his desire and his doom: thus
for the sake of his virtue he wants to live on and to live no more.

I love the one who does not want to have too many virtues. One virtue
is more virtue than two, because it is more of a hook on which his doom
may hang.

I love the one whose soul squanders itself, who wants no thanks and
gives none back: for he always gives and does not want to preserve
himself.4

I love the one who is ashamed when the dice fall to his fortune and who
then asks: am I a cheater? — For he wants to perish.

I love the one who casts golden words before his deeds and always does
even more than he promises: for he wants his going under.

I love the one who justiﬁes people of the future and redeems those of
the past: for he wants to perish of those in the present.

I love the one who chastises his god, because he loves his god: for he
must perish of the wrath of his god.

I love the one whose soul is deep even when wounded, and who can
perish of a small experience: thus he goes gladly over the bridge.

I love the one whose soul is overfull, so that he forgets himself, and all
things are in him: thus all things become his going under.

4 See Luke 17:33. This is the ﬁrst ofapproximately 135 direct allusions to the Bible, in which Nietzsche
typically applies Christ‘s words to Zarathustra‘s task, or inverts Christ‘s words in order to achieve
a life— and earth—afﬁrming effect. Whenever possible, these passages will be translated using the
phrasing ofthe Bible. For drafts and alternative versions ofthe Various chapters, biblical references,

I love the one who is free of spirit and heart: thus his head is only the
entrails of his heart, but his heart drives him to his going under.

I love all those who are like heavy drops falling individually from the
dark cloud that hangs over humanity: they herald the coming of the
lightning, and as heralds they perish.

Behold, I am a herald of the lightning and a heavy drop from the cloud:
but this lightning is called overman. 7”

When Zarathustra had spoken these words he looked again at the people
and fell silent. “There they stand,” he said to his heart, “they laugh, they
do not understand me, I am not the mouth for these ears.

Must one ﬁrst smash their ears so that they learn to hear with their
eyes? Must one rattle like kettle drums and penitence preachers? Or do
they believe only a stutterer?

They have something of which they are proud. And what do they call
that which makes them proud? Education they call it, it distinguishes
them from goatherds.

For that reason they hate to hear the word ‘contempt' applied to them.
So I shall address their pride instead.

Thus I shall speak to them of the most contemptible person: but he is
the last human heiug.”

And thus spoke Zarathustra to the people:

“It is time that mankind set themselves a goal. It is time that mankind
plant the seed of their highest hope.

Their soil is still rich enough for this. But one day this soil will be poor
and tame, and no tall tree will be able to grow from it anymore.

Beware! The time approaches when human beings no longer launch
the arrow of their longing beyond the human, and the string of their bow
will have forgotten how to whir!

I say to you: one must still have chaos in oneself in order to give birth
to a dancing star. I say to you: you still have chaos in you.

Beware! The time approaches when human beings will no longer give
birth to a dancing star. Beware! The time of the most contemptible
human is coming, the one who can no longer have contempt for
himself.

Behold! I show you the last human heihg.

‘What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?' —
thus asks the last human being, blinking.

Then the earth has become small, and on it hops the last human being,
who makes everything small. His kind is ineradicable, like the ﬂea beetle;
the last human being lives longest.

‘We invented happiness' — say the last human beings, blinking.

They abandoned the regions where it was hard to live: for one needs
warmth. One still loves one's neighbor and rubs up against him: for one
needs warmth.

Becoming ill and being mistrustful are considered sinful by them:
one proceeds with caution. A fool who still stumbles over stones or
humans!

A bit of poison once in a while; that makes for pleasant dreams. And
much poison at the end, for a pleasant death.

One still works, for work is a form of entertainment. But one sees to it
that the entertainment is not a strain.

One no longer becomes poor and rich: both are too burdensome. Who
wants to rule anymore? Who wants to obey anymore? Both are too bur—
densome.

No shepherd and one herd! Each wants the same, each is the same, and
whoever feels differently goes voluntarily into the insane asylum.

‘Formerly the whole world was insane' — the ﬁnest ones say, blinking.

One is clever and knows everything that has happened, and so there is
no end to their mockery. People still quarrel but they reconcile quickly —
otherwise it is bad for the stomach.

One has one's little pleasure for the day and one's little pleasure for the
night: but one honors health.

‘We invented happiness' say the last human beings, and they blink.”

And here ended the ﬁrst speech of Zarathustra, which is also called
“The Prologue,” for at this point he was interrupted by the yelling and
merriment of the crowd. “Give us this last human being, oh Zarathustra” —
thus they cried — “make us into these last human beings! Then we will
make you a gift of the overman!” And all the people jubilated and clicked
their tongues. But Zarathustra grew sad and said to his heart:

“They do not understand me. I am not the mouth for these ears.

Too long apparently I lived in the mountains, too much I listened to
brooks and trees: now I speak to them as to goatherds.

IO

F irst Part



My soul is calm and bright as the morning mountains. But they believe
I am cold, that I jeer, that I deal in terrible jests.

And now they look at me and laugh, and in laughing they hate me too.
There is ice in their laughter.”

6

Then, however, something happened that struck every mouth silent and
forced all eyes to stare. For in the meantime the tightrope walker had
begun his work; he had emerged from a little door and was walking across
the rope stretched between two towers, such that it hung suspended
over the market place and the people. Just as he was at the midpoint of his
way, the little door opened once again and a colorful fellow resembling
a jester leaped forth and hurried after the ﬁrst man with quick steps.
“Forward, sloth, smuggler, pale face! Or I'll tickle you with my heel! What
business have you here between the towers? You belong in the tower, you
should be locked away in the tower, for you block the way for one who is
better than you!” And with each word he came closer and closer to him.
But when he was only one step behind him, the terrifying thing occurred
that struck every mouth silent and forced all eyes to stare: — he let out a yell
like a devil and leaped over the man who was in his way. This man, seeing
his rival triumph in this manner, lost his head and the rope. He threw
away his pole and plunged into the depths even faster than his pole, like a
whirlwind of arms and legs. The market place and the people resembled
the sea when a storm charges in: everyone ﬂed apart and into one another,
and especially in the spot where the body had to impact.

But Zarathustra stood still and the body landed right beside him, badly
beaten and broken, but not yet dead. After a while the shattered man
regained consciousness and saw Zarathustra kneeling beside him. “What
are you doing here?” he said ﬁnally. “I've known for a long time that the
devil would trip me up. Now he is going to drag me off to hell: are you
going to stop him?”

“By my honor, friend!” answered Zarathustra. “All that you are talking
about does not exist. There is no devil and no hell. Your soul will be dead
even sooner than your body — fear no more!”

The man looked up mistrustfully. “If you speak the truth,” he said,
“then I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an
animal that has been taught to dance by blows and little treats.”

II

Thus S polee Zara thustra



“Not at all,” said Zarathustra. “You made your vocation out of danger,
and there is nothing contemptible about that. Now you perish of your
vocation, and for that I will bury you with my own hands.”

When Zarathustra said this the dying man answered no more, but he
moved his hand as if seeking Zarathustra's hand in gratitude. —

7

Meanwhile eveningcame and the market place hid in darkness. The people
scattered, for even curiosity and terror grow weary. But Zarathustra sat
beside the dead man on the ground and was lost in thought, such that he
lost track of time. Night came at last and a cold wind blew over the lonely
one. Then Zarathustra stood up and said to his heart:

“Indeed, a nice catch of ﬁsh Zarathustra has today! No human being
did he catch, but a corpse instead.

Uncanny is human existence and still without meaning: a jester can
spell its doom.

I want to teach humans the meaning of their being, which is the over—
man, the lightning from the dark cloud ‘human being.'

But I am still far away from them, and I do not make sense to their
senses. For mankind I am still a midpoint between a fool and a corpse.

The night is dark, the ways of Zarathustra are dark. Come, my cold

and stiff companion! I shall carry you where I will bury you with my own
hands.”

8

When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he hoisted the corpse onto
his back and started on his way. And he had not yet gone a hundred paces
when someone sneaked up on him and whispered in his ear — and behold!
The one who spoke was the jester from the tower. “Go away from this
town, oh Zarathustra,” he said. “Too many here hate you. The good and
the just hate you and they call you their enemy and despiser; the believers
of the true faith hate you and they call you the danger of the multitude.
It was your good fortune that they laughed at you: and really, you spoke
like a jester. It was your good fortune that you took up with the dead dog;
when you lowered yourself like that, you rescued yourself for today. But
go away from this town — or tomorrow I shall leap over you, a living man

12

F irst Part



over a dead one.” And when he had said this, the man disappeared, but
Zarathustra continued his walk through dark lanes.

At the town gate he met the gravediggers. They shone their torches in
his face, recognized Zarathustra and sorely ridiculed him. “Zarathustra
is lugging away the dead dog: how nice that he's become a gravedigger!
For our hands are too pure for this roast. Would Zarathustra steal this
morsel from the devil? So be it then! And good luck with your meal! If
only the devil were not a better thief than Zarathustra! — he'll steal them
both, he'll devour them both!” And they laughed and huddled together.

Zarathustra did not say a word and went on his way. By the time
he had walked for two hours past woods and swamps, he had heard
too much of the hungry howling of wolves and he grew hungry
himself. And so he stopped at a lonely house in which a light was
burning.

“Hunger falls upon me like a robber,” said Zarathustra. “In woods and
swamps my hunger falls upon me and in the deep night.

My hunger has odd moods. Often it comes to me only after a meal, and
today it did not come the whole day: just where was it?”

And so Zarathustra pounded on the door to the house. An old man
appeared, bearing a light, and he asked: “Who comes to me and to my
bad sleep?”

“A living man and a dead one,” replied Zarathustra. “Give me food and
drink, I forgot it during the day. Whoever feeds the hungry quickens his
own soul — thus speaks wisdom.”

The old man went away but returned promptly and offered Zarathus—
tra bread and wine. “This is a bad region for those who hunger,” he
said. “That is why I live here. Beast and human being come to me, the
hermit. But bid your companion eat and drink, he is wearier than you.”
Zarathustra replied: “My companion is dead, I would have a hard time
persuading him.” “That does not concern me,” snapped the old man.
“Whoever knocks at my house must also take what I offer him. Eat and
take care!” —

Thereupon Zarathustra walked again for two hours, trusting the path
and the light of the stars, for he was a practiced night—walker and loved
to look in the face of all sleepers. But as dawn greyed Zarathustra found
himself in a deep wood and no more path was Visible to him. Then he laid
the dead man into a hollow tree — for he wanted to protect him from the
wolves — and he laid himself down head ﬁrst at the tree, upon the earth

13

Thus S polee Zara thustra



and the moss. And soon he fell asleep, weary in body but with a calm
soul.

9

Long Zarathustra slept, and not only the dawn passed over his face
but the morning as well. At last, however, he opened his eyes: amazed
Zarathustra looked into the woods and the silence, amazed he looked into
himself. Then he stood up quickly, like a seafarer who all at once sees
land, and he rejoiced, for he saw a new truth. And thus he spoke to his
heart:

“It dawned on me: I need companions, and living ones — not dead
companions and corpses that I carry with me wherever I want.

Instead I need living companions who follow me because they want to
follow themselves — wherever I want.

It dawned on me: let Zarathustra speak not to the people, but instead
to companions! Zarathustra should not become the shepherd and dog of
a herd!

To lure many away from the herd — for that I came. The people and
herd shall be angry with me: Zarathustra wants to be called a robber by
shepherds.

Shepherds I say, but they call themselves the good and the just. Shep—
herds I say: but they call themselves the faithful of the true faith.

Look at the good and the just! Whom do they hate most? The one who
breaks their tablets of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker — but he is the
creative one.

Look at the faithful of all faiths! Whom do they hate most? The one
who breaks their tablets of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker — but he is
the creative one.

Companions the creative one seeks and not corpses, nor herds and
believers. Fellow creators the creative one seeks, who will write new values
on new tablets.

Companions the creative one seeks, and fellow harvesters; for to him
everything stands ready for harvest. But he lacks the hundred scythes,
and so he plucks out spikes and is angry.

Companions the creative one seeks, and those who know how to whet
their scythes. They shall be called annihilators and despisers of good and
evil. But they are the harvesters and the celebrators.

Fellow creators seeks Zarathustra, fellow harvesters and fellow cele—
brators Zarathustra seeks: what need does he have of herds and shepherds
and corpses!

And you, my ﬁrst companion, take care! I buried you well in your tree,
I concealed you well from the wolves.

But I am leaving you, the time is up. Between dawn and dawn a new
truth came to me.

I shall not be a shepherd, nor a gravedigger. I do not want to even
speak again with the people — for the last time have I spoken to a dead
person.

I shall join the creators, the harvesters, the celebrators: I shall show
them the rainbow and all the steps to the overman.

I shall sing my song to lonesome and twosome hermits, and for him
who still has ears for the unheard of, I shall make his heart heavy with my
happiness.

I want to go to my goal, and I go my own way; over the hesitating and
dawdling I shall leap. Thus let my going be their going under!”

Thus Zarathustra had spoken to his heart when the sun stood at noon,
then he gazed at the sky with a questioninglook, for above him he heard the
sharp cry of a bird. And behold! An eagle cut broad circles through the
air, and upon it hung a snake, not as prey but as a friend, for the snake
curled itself around the eagle's neck.

“It is my animals!” said Zarathustra, and his heart was delighted.

“The proudest animal under the sun and the wisest animal under the
sun — they have gone forth to scout.

They want to determine whether Zarathustra is still alive. Indeed, am
I still alive?

I found it more dangerous among human beings than among animals;
Zarathustra walks dangerous paths. May my animals guide me!”

When Zarathustra had said this he recalled the words of the saint in
the woods, sighed and spoke thus to his heart:

“May I be wiser! May I be wise from the ground up like my snake!

But I ask the impossible, and so I ask instead of my pride that it always
walk with my wisdom!

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And if some day my wisdom abandons me — oh it loves to ﬂy away! —
may my pride then ﬂy away with my folly!”
— Thus began Zarathustra's going under.

The Speeches 0f Zarathustra
Oh the Three Metamorphoses

Three metamorphoses of the spirit I name for you: how the spirit becomes
a camel, and the camel a lion, and ﬁnally the lion a child.

To the spirit there is much that is heavy; to the strong, carrying
spirit imbued with reverence. Its strength demands what is heavy and
heaviest.

What is heavy? thus asks the carrying spirit. It kneels down like a camel
and wants to be well loaded.

What is heaviest, you heroes? thus asks the carrying spirit, so that I
might take it upon myself and rejoice in my strength.

Is it not this: lowering oneself in order to hurt one's pride? Letting
one's foolishness glow in order to mock one's wisdom?

Or is it this: abandoning our cause when it celebrates Victory? Climbing
high mountains in order to tempt the tempter?

Or is it this: feeding on the acorns and grass of knowledge and for the
sake of truth suffering hunger in one's soul?

Or is it this: being ill and sending the comforters home and making
friends with the deaf who never hear what you want?

Or is it this: wading into dirty water when it is the water of truth, and
not shrinking away from cold frogs and hot toads?

Or is it this: loving those who despise us, and extending a hand to the
ghost when it wants to frighten us?

All of these heaviest things the carrying spirit takes upon itself, like
a loaded camel that hurries into the desert, thus it hurries into its
desert.

But in the loneliest desert the second metamorphosis occurs. Here the
spirit becomes lion, it wants to hunt down its freedom and be master in
its own desert.

Here it seeks its last master, and wants to ﬁght him and its last god. For
Victory it wants to battle the great dragon.

16

F irst Part



Who is the great dragon whom the spirit no longer wants to call master
and god? “Thou shalt” is the name of the great dragon. But the spirit of
the lion says “I will.”

“Thou shalt” stands in its way, gleaming golden, a scaly animal, and
upon every scale “thou shalt!” gleams like gold.

The values of millennia gleam on these scales, and thus speaks the most
powerful of all dragons: “the value of all things — it gleams in me.

All value has already been created, and the value of all created things —
that am I. Indeed, there shall be no more ‘I will!'” Thus speaks the
dragon.

My brothers, why is the lion required by the spirit? Why does the beast
of burden, renouncing and reverent, not sufﬁce?

To create new values — not even the lion is capable of that: but to create
freedom for itself for new creation — that is within the power of the lion.

To create freedom for oneself and also a sacred No to duty: for that,
my brothers, the lion is required.

To take the right to new values — that is the most terrible taking for
a carrying and reverent spirit. Indeed, it is preying, and the work of a
predatory animal.

Once it loved “thou shalt” as its most sacred, now it must ﬁnd delusion
and despotism even in what is most sacred to it, in order to wrest freedom
from its love by preying. The lion is required for this preying.

But tell me, my brothers, of what is the child capable that even the lion
is not? Why must the preying lion still become a child?

The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a wheel
rolling out of itself, a ﬁrst movement, a sacred yes—saying.

Yes, for the game of creation my brothers a sacred yes—saying is required.
The spirit wants its will, the one lost to the world now wins its own world.

Three metamorphoses of the spirit I named for you: how the spirit
became a camel, and the camel a lion, and ﬁnally the lion a child. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra. And then he sojourned in the town which is
called The Motley Cow.

Oh the Teachers of Virtue

A wise man was praised to Zarathustra who could speak well of sleep and
of Virtue. For this he was much honored and rewarded, and all the youths

I7

Thus S polee Zara thustra



sat at his feet. Zarathustra went to him and sat at his feet with all the
youths. And thus spoke the wise man:

“Have honor and bashfulness for sleep! That is the ﬁrst thing! And
avoid all who sleep badly and remain awake nights!

Even the thief is bashful toward sleep; he constantly steals through the
night, silently. But the watchman of the night is shameless, and shame—
lessly he carries his horn.

Sleeping is no mean art, it is necessary to remain awake the entire day
for it.

Ten times a day you must overcome yourself, that makes for a good
weariness and is poppy for the soul.

Ten times you must reconcile yourself again with yourself, for over—
coming causes bitterness and the unreconciled sleep badly.

Ten truths you must ﬁnd by day, or else you will still be seeking truth
by night and your soul will have remained hungry.

Ten times you must laugh by day and be cheerful, or else your stomach
will bother you at night, this father of gloom.

Few know it but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep well.
Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?

Shall I covet my neighbor's maid? All that would be incompatible with
good sleep.

And even when one has all the virtues, one must understand one more
thing: how to send the virtues to sleep at the right time.

So that they do not quarrel with each other, the good little women! And
quarrel over you, wretch!

At peace with God and neighbor, thus good sleep demands. And at
peace too with the neighbor's devil! Otherwise he will be at your house at
night.

Honor the authorities and practice obedience, even toward the crooked
authorities! Thus good sleep demands. What can I do about it that the
powers like to walk on crooked legs? He shall always be the best shepherd
in my view who leads his sheep to the greenest pasture; this is compatible
with good sleep.

I do not want many honors, nor great treasures — that inﬂames the
spleen. But sleep is bad without a good name and a little treasure.

A little company is more welcome to me than evil company, but they
must go and come at the right time, for this is compatible with good
sleep.

F irst Part



I also like very much the poor in spirit, they promote sleep. Blessed are
they, especially when they are always told they are right.

Thus passes the day for the Virtuous one. Now when night comes I am
careful not to summon sleep — the master of virtues does not like to be
summoned!

Instead I think what I have done and thought throughout the day. Rumi—
nating, I ask myself, patient as a cow; what then were my ten overcomings?

And what were the ten reconciliations and the ten truths and the ten
laughters to which my heart treated itself?

In this manner reﬂecting and rocked by forty thoughts, sleep suddenly
falls upon me, the unsummoned, the master of Virtues.

Sleep knocks at my eyelids, and they become heavy. Sleeps brushes my
mouth, and it stays open.

Truly, on soft soles it comes to me, the dearest of thieves, and steals my
thoughts: stupid I stand there like this chair.

But then I am not standing for long, and soon I am lying.” —

When Zarathustra heard the wise man speak thus, he laughed inwardly
in his heart, for something dawned on him, and he spoke thus to his heart:

“That wise man there with his forty thoughts is just a fool to me, but I
believe that he well understands sleep.

Happy the one who lives even near this wise man! Such a sleep is
infectious, and it infects even through a thick wall.

In this teacher nothing less than magic resides, and not in vain did
youths sit at the feet of this preacher of virtue.

The meaning of his wisdom is: wake in order to sleep well. And truly,
if life had no meaning and if I had to choose nonsense, then to me too this
would be the worthiest nonsense I could choose.

Now I understand clearly what was once sought before all else when
teachers of virtue were sought. Good sleep was sought and poppy—
blossomed virtues to boot!

For all these highly praised wise men and teachers wisdom was the
sleep without dreams: they knew no better meaning of life.

And still today there are a few like this preacher of virtue, and some
not so honest. But their time is up, not for long will they be standing, and
soon they'll be lying.

Blessed are these sleepy ones, for they shall soon nod of .” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Oh the Hinterworldly5

Once Zarathustra too cast his delusion beyond humans, like all hinter—
worldly. At that time the world seemed to me the work of a suffering and
tortured god.

Then the world seemed a dream to me and the ﬁction of a god; colorful
smoke before the eyes of a divine dissatisﬁed being.

Good and evil and joy and suffering and I and you — colorful smoke it
seemed to me before creative eyes. The creator wanted to look away from
himself and so he created the world.

It is drunken joy to the suffering one to look away from one's suffering
and to lose oneself. Drunken joy and losing—oneself the world once seemed
to me.

This world, the eternally imperfect, the mirror image and imperfect
image of an eternal contradiction — a drunken joy to its imperfect creator:
thus the world once seemed to me.

So I too once cast my delusion beyond humans, like all hinterworldly.
Beyond humans in truth?

Oh my brothers, this god that I created was of human make and mad—
ness, like all gods!

Human he was, and only a poor ﬂake of human and ego. From my own
ash and ember it came to me, this ghost, and truly! It did not come to me
from beyond!

What happened, my brothers? I overcame myself, my suffering self,
I carried my own ashes to the mountain, I invented a brighter ﬂame for
myself and behold! The ghost shraule from me!

Now it would be suffering and torture for the convalesced one to believe
in such ghosts. Now it would be suffering and humiliation. Thus I speak
to the hinterworldly.

It was suffering and incapacity that created all hinterworlds, and that
brief madness of happiness that only the most suffering person experi—
ences.

5 “Von den Hinterweltlern,” literally: on those who are of, or believe in, a world beyond, a hidden
or a back—world, a secret world, bears similar connotations to English hinterland, i.e. regions that
are remote, far away from the cities. Hintermartrt is a man behind the scenes, a secret advisor;
Hintergetlart/eert are secret thoughts or ulterior motives. Hinterrt as a noun is the same as English
“behind,” with behind meaning a person‘s backside.

Weariness that wants its ultimate with one great leap, with a death leap;
a poor unknowing weariness that no longer even wants to will: that created
all gods and hinterworlds.

Believe me, my brothers! It was the body that despaired of the body —
it probed with the ﬁngers of a befooled spirit on the walls of the
ultimate.

Believe me, my brothers! It was the body that despaired of the earth —
then it heard the belly of being speaking to it.

And then it wanted to break head ﬁrst through the ultimate walls, and
not only with its head, beyond to “the other world.”

But “the other world” is well hidden from humans, that dehumaned,
inhuman world that is a heavenly nothing. And the belly of being does
not speak at all to humans, unless as a human.

Indeed, all being is hard to prove and hard to coax to speech. Tell me,
my brothers, is not the strangest of all things still proven best?

Yes, this ego and the ego's contradiction and confusion still speak most
honestly about its being; this creating, willing, valuing ego which is the
measure and value of things.

And this most honest being, this ego — it speaks of love and it still wants
the body, even when it poetizes and fantasizes and ﬂutters with broken
wings.

It learns to speak ever more honestly, this ego. And the more it learns,
the more it ﬁnds words and honors for the body and the earth.

My ego taught me a new pride, I teach it to mankind: no longer bury
your head in the sand of heavenly things, but bear it freely instead, an
earthly head that creates a meaning for the earth!

I teach mankind a new will: to want the path that human beings have
traveled blindly, to pronounce it good and no longer sneak to the side of
it like the sick and the dying—out.

It was the sick and the dying—out who despised the body and the
earth and invented the heavenly and its redeeming drops of blood. But
even these sweet and shadowy poisons they took from the body and the
earth!

They wanted to escape their misery and the stars were too distant for
them. So they sighed “Oh if only there were heavenly paths on which
to sneak into another being and happiness!” — Then they invented their
schemes and bloody little drinks!

21

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Now they fancied themselves detached from this earth, these ingrates.
But what did they have to thank for the ﬁts and bliss of their detachment?
Their body and this earth.

Zarathustra is gentle to the sick. Indeed, he is not angered by their
ways of comfort and ingratitude. May they become convalescents and
overcomers and create for themselves a higher body!

Nor is he angered by the convalescent when he tenderly gazes upon
his delusion and sneaks around the grave of his God at midnight. But to
me even his tears remain sickness and sick body.

There were always many sickly people among those who poetize and are
addicted to God; with rage they hate the knowing ones and that youngest
of virtues which is called honesty.

Backward they look always toward darker times, for then, truly, delusion
and faith were another matter. Raving of reason was next to godliness, and
doubting was sin.

All too well I know these neXt—to—godliness types: they want people to
believe in them, and that doubting is sin. All too well I know also what
they themselves believe in most.

Indeed, not in hinterworlds and redeeming blood drops, but instead
they too believe most in the body, and their own body is to them their
thing in itself.

But to them it is a sickly thing, and gladly would they jump out of
their skin. Hence they listen to the preachers of death and they preach of
hinterworlds themselves.

Hear my brothers, hear the voice of the healthy body: a more honest
and purer voice is this.

More honestly and more purely speaks the healthy body, the perfect
and perpendicular body, and it speaks of the meaning of the earth.

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Despisers 0f the Body

To the despisers of the body I want to say my words. I do not think they
should relearn and teach differently, instead they should bid their own
bodies farewell — and thus fall silent.

“Body am I and soul” — so speaks a child. And why should one not
speak like children?

22

F irst Part



But the awakened, the knowing one says: body am I through and
through, and nothing besides; and soul is just a word for something on
the body.

The body is a great reason, a multiplicity with one sense, a war and a
peace, one herd and one shepherd.

Your small reason, what you call “spirit” is also a tool of your body, my
brother, a small work— and plaything of your great reason.

“I” you say and are proud of this word. But what is greater is that in
which you do not want to believe — your body and its great reason. It does
not say I, but does I.

What the sense feels, what the spirit knows, in itself that will never have
an end. But sense and spirit would like to persuade you that they are the
end of all things: so vain are they.

Work— and plaything are sense and spirit, behind them still lies the self.
The self also seeks with the eyes of the senses, it listens also with the ears
of the spirit.

Always the self listens and seeks: it compares, compels, conquers,
destroys. It rules and is also the ruler of the ego.

Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, stands a powerful com—
mander, an unknown wise man — he is called self. He lives in your body,
he is your body.

There is more reason in your body than in your best wisdom. And
who knows then to what end your body requires precisely your best
wisdom?

Your self laughs at your ego and its proud leaps. “What are these
leaps and ﬂights of thought to me?” it says to itself. “A detour to my
purpose. I am the leading strings of the ego and the prompter of its
concepts.”

The self says to the ego: “Feel pain here!” And then it suffers and
reﬂects on how it might suffer no more — and just for that purpose it is
supposed to think.

The self says to the ego: “Feel pleasure here!” Then it is pleased and
reﬂects on how it might feel pleased more often — and for that purpose it
is supposed to think!

To the despisers of the body I want to say a word. That they disrespect
is based on their respect. What is it that created respect and disrespect
and value and will?

23

Thus S polee Zara thustra



The creative self created respect and disrespect for itself, it created
pleasure and pain for itself. The creative body created spirit for itself as
the hand of its will.

Even in your folly and your contempt, you despisers of the body, you
serve your self. I say to you: your self itself wants to die and turns away
from life.

No longer is it capable of that which it wants most: to create beyond
itself. This it wants most of all, this is its entire fervor.

But now it is too late for that, and so your self wants to go under, you
despisers of the body.

Your self wants to go under, and for this reason you became despis—
ers of the body! For you no longer are capable of creating beyond
yourselves.

And that is why you are angry now at life and earth. There is an
unknown envy in the looking askance of your contempt.

I will not go your way, you despisers of the body! You are not my bridges
to the overman! —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Passions ofPleasure and Pain

My brother, if you have one virtue, and it is your virtue, then you have it
in common with no one.

To be sure, you want to call her by name and caress her; you want to
tug at her ear and have fun with her.

And behold! Now you have her name in common with the people and
have become the people and the herd with your virtue!

You would do better to say: “Unspeakable and nameless is that which
causes my soul agony and sweetness and is even the hunger of my
entrails.”

Let your virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if you must
speak of it, then do not be ashamed to stammer about it.

Then speak and stammer: “This is my good, I love this, thus I like it
entirely, thus alone do I want the good.

I do not want it as a divine law, I do not want is as a human statute
and requirement. It shall be no signpost for me to overearths and
paradises.

24

F irst Part



It is an earthly virtue that I love: there is little prudence in it and least
of all the reason of the many.

But this bird built its nest in my house, therefore I love and caress it,
now it sits next to me on its golden eggs.”

Thus you should stammer and praise your Virtue.

Once you had passions and named them evil. But now you have only
your virtues: they grew out of your passions.

You set your highest goal at the heart of these passions, and then they
became your virtues and passions of pleasure.

And whether you stemmed from the clan of the irascible or the lasciv—
ious or the fanatic or the vengeful:

Ultimately all your passions became virtues and all your devils became
angels.

Once you had wild dogs in your cellar, but ultimately they transformed
into birds and lovely singers.

Out of your poisons you brewed your balsam; your cow, melancholy,
you milked — now you drink the sweet milk of its udder.

And now nothing evil grows anymore out of you, unless it is the evil
that grows from the struggle among your virtues.

My brother, if you are lucky then you have one virtue and no more:
thus will you go more easily over the bridge.

It is distinguishing to have many virtues, but it is a hard lot. And many
went into the desert and killed themselves because they were weary of
being the battle and battleﬁeld of Virtues. My brother, are war and battle
evil? But this evil is necessary, envy and mistrust and slander among your
virtues are necessary.

Look, how each of your virtues is greedy for the highest. It wants your
entire spirit, to be its herald; it wants your entire strength in rage, hatred
and love.

Each virtue is jealous of the other, and jealousy is a terrible thing. Even
virtues can perish of jealousy.

Whoever is ringed by the ﬂame of jealousy in the end will turn his
poisonous stinger upon himself, like the scorpion.

Oh my brother, have you never seen a virtue slander and stab itself?

Human being is something that must be overcome, and therefore you
should love your virtues — for of them you will perish. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Oh the Pale Criminal

You do want to kill, you judges and sacriﬁcers, until the animal has nodded?
Behold, the pale criminal has nodded: from his eyes speaks the great
contempt.

“My ego is something that shall be overcome: my ego is to me the great
contempt for mankind,” so speak these eyes.

That he condemned himself was his highest moment: do not allow the
sublime one to return to his baseness!

There is no redemption for one who suffers so from himself, unless it
were the quick death.

Your killing, you judges, should be pity and not revenge. And insofar
as you kill, see to it that you yourselves justify life!

It is not enough that you reconcile yourself with the one you kill. Let
your sadness be love for the overman — thus you justify that you still
live!

“Enemy” you should say, but not “villain”; “sick man” you should say,
but not “scoundrel”; “fool” you should say, but not “sinner.”

And you, red judge, if you were to speak aloud all the things you have
already done in your thoughts, then everyone would cry: “Away with this
ﬁlth and poisonous worm!”

But thought is one thing, and deed another, and the image of
a deed yet another. The wheel of motive does not roll between
them.

An image made this pale human pale. He was equal to his deed when
he committed it, but he could not bear its image once he had done it.

From then on he always saw himself as the doer of one deed. I call this
madness: the exception reversed itself to the essence.

A streak in the dirt stops a hen cold; the stroke he executed stopped
his poor reason cold — madness after the deed I call this.

Listen, you judges! There is still another madness, and it is before the
deed. Oh, you did not crawl deeply enough into this soul!

Thus speaks the red judge: “Why did this criminal kill? He wanted to
rob.” But I say to you: his soul wanted blood, not robbery. He thirsted for
the bliss of the knife!

But his poor reason did not comprehend this madness and it persuaded
him. “What does blood matter?” it said. “Don't you at least want to commit
robbery in the process? Take revenge?”

26

F irst Part



And so he listened to his poor reason, like lead its speech lay upon
him — and he robbed as he murdered. He did not want to be ashamed of
his madness.

And now the lead of his guilt lies on him again, and again his poor
reason is so stiff, so paralyzed, so heavy.

If only he could shake his head, then his burden would roll off — but
who could shake this head?

What is this human being? A pile of illnesses that reach out into the
world through his spirit: there they seek their prey.

What is this human being? A ball of wild snakes that seldom have peace
from each other — so they go forth for themselves and seek prey in the
world.

Behold this poor body! What it suffered and craved this poor soul
interpreted for itself — it interpreted it as murderous lust and greed for
the bliss of the knife.

Whoever grows ill now is befallen by the evil that is evil now; he wants
to hurt with that which makes him hurt. But there have been other ages
and another evil and good.

Once doubt was evil and the will to self. Back then sick people became
heretics and witches: as heretics and witches they suffered and wanted to
cause suffering.

But this does not want to get to your ears: it harms your good people,
you say to me. But what matter your good people to me!

There is much about your good people that makes me disgusted, and
verily not their evil. I wish they had a madness from which they would
perish, like this pale criminal!

Indeed, I wish their madness were called truth or loyalty or justice —
but they have their virtue in order to live long and in pitiful contentment.

I am a railing by the torrent: grasp me whoever is able to grasp me! But
your crutch I am not. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Reading auel Writing

Of all that is written I love only that which one writes with his blood.
Write with blood, and you will experience that blood is spirit.

It is not easily possible to understand the blood of another: I hate the
reading idlers.

27

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Whoever knows the reader will do nothing more for the reader. One
more century of readers — and the spirit itself will stink.

That everyone is allowed to learn to read ruins not only writing in the
long run, but thinking too.

Once the spirit was God, then it became human and now it is even
becoming rabble.

Whoever writes in blood and proverbs does not want to be read, but to
be learned by heart.

In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that
one must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those who are
addressed should be great and tall.

The air thin and pure, danger near and the spirit full of cheerful spite:
these ﬁt together well.

I want to have goblins around me, for I am courageous. Courage
that scares off ghosts creates its own goblins — courage wants to
laugh.

I no longer sympathize with you; this cloud beneath me, this black and
heavy thing at which I laugh — precisely this is your thundercloud.

You look upward when you long for elevation. And I look down because
I am elevated.

Who among you can laugh and be elevated at the same time?

Whoever climbs the highest mountain laughs at all tragic plays and
tragic realities.

Courageous, unconcerned, sarcastic, violent — thus wisdom wants us:
she is a woman and always loves only a warrior.

You say to me: “Life is hard to bear.” But why would you have your
pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?

Life is hard to bear: but then do not carry on so tenderly! We are all of
us handsome, load bearing jack— and jillasses.

What have we in common with the rosebud that trembles because a
drop of dew lies on its body?

It is true: we love life not because we are accustomed to life but because
we are accustomed to love.

There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some
reason in madness.

And even to me, one who likes life, it seems butterﬂies and soap bubbles
and whatever is of their kind among human beings know most about
happiness.

To see these light, foolish, delicate, sensitive little souls ﬂuttering — that
seduces Zarathustra to tears and songs.

I would only believe in a god who knew how to dance.

And when I saw my devil, there I found him earnest, thorough, deep,
somber: it was the spirit of gravity — through him all things fall.

Not by wrath does one kill, but by laughing. Up, let us kill the spirit of
gravity!

I learned to walk, since then I let myselfrun. I learned to ﬂy, since then
I do not wait to be pushed to move from the spot.

Now I am light, now I ﬂy, now I see myself beneath me, now a god
dances through me.

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Tree ah the Mountain

Zarathustra's eyes had discerned that a young man avoided him. As he
walked one evening alone through the mountains surrounding the town,
which is called The Motley Cow, behold, there while walking he found
this young man leaning against a tree, gazing wearily into the valley.
Zarathustra grasped the tree at which the young man sat, and spoke
thus:

“If I wanted to shake this tree here with my hands, I would not be able
[0.

But the wind that we do not see torments and bends it wherever it
wants. We are bent and tormented worst by invisible hands.”

Then the young man stood up, perplexed, and said: “I hear Zarathustra
and I was just thinking about him.” Zarathustra responded:

“Why are you startled by this? — But it is with human beings as it is
with this tree.

The more they aspire to the heights and the light, the more strongly
their roots strive earthward, downward, into darkness, depths — into evil.”

“Yes, into evil!” cried the young man. “How is it possible that you
discovered my soul?”

Zarathustra smiled and said: “Some souls will never be discovered,
unless they are ﬁrst invented.”

“Yes, into evil!” cried the young man again.

“You speak the truth, Zarathustra. I no longer trust myselfsince aspir—
ing to the heights, and no one trusts me anymore — how did this happen?

29

Thus S polee Zara thustra



I'm changing too fast. My today contradicts my yesterday. I often skip
steps when I climb — no step forgives me that.

If I am at the top then I always ﬁnd myself alone. No one speaks
with me, the frost of loneliness makes me shiver. What do I want in the
heights?

How ashamed I am of my climbing and stumbling! How I mock my
violent panting! How I hate the ﬂying one! How weary I am in the heights!”

Here the young man fell silent. And Zarathustra regarded the tree at
which they stood and spoke thus:

“This tree stands here lonely on the mountain; it grew high beyond
humans and animals.

And if it wanted to speak, it would have no one who understood it: so
high it grew.

Now it waits and waits — but for what does it wait? It lives too near the
clouds' abode: it waits for the ﬁrst lightning bolt?”

When Zarathustra had said this the young man cried out, gesturing
agitatedly: “Yes, Zarathustra, you speak the truth. I longed for my destruc—
tion when I aspired to the heights, and you are the lightning for which
I waited! Look, what am I anymore, now that you have appeared among
us! It is my envy of you that has destroyed me!” — Thus spoke the young
man and he wept bitterly. But Zarathustra put his arm around him and
led him away.

And after they had walked together for a while Zarathustra started
speaking thus:

“It tears my heart apart. Better than your words can say, your eyes tell
me all your danger.

You are still not free, you seele freedom. Your seeking made you sleep—
deprived and over—awake.

You aspire to the free heights, your soul thirsts for the stars. But your
wicked instincts also thirst for freedom.

Your wild dogs want to get free; they bark with joy in their cellar when
your spirit contrives to liberate all prisons.

To me you are still a prisoner who plots his freedom. Alas, the soul of
such prisoners grows clever, but also deceptive and rotten.

The one who is free of spirit must still purify himself. Much prison
and mold is left in him: his eyes must still become pure.

Yes, I know your danger. But by my love and hope I beseech you: do
not throw away your love and hope!

You still feel noble, and the others who grudge you and give you the
evil eye, they still feel your nobility too. Know that a noble person stands
in everyone's way.

A noble person also stands in the way of the good: and even when they
call him a good man, they do so in order to get rid of him.

The noble person wants to create new things and a new Virtue. The
good person wants old things, and for old things to be preserved.

But it is not the danger of the noble one that he will become a good
person, but a churl, a mocker, an annihilator.

Oh, I knew noble people who lost their highest hope. And then they
slandered all high hopes.

Then they lived churlishly in brief pleasures, scarcely casting their
goals beyond the day.

‘Spirit is lust too' — so they spoke. Then the wings of their spirit broke,
and now it crawls around and soils what it gnaws.

Once they thought of becoming heroes: now they are libertines. To
them the hero is grief and ghastliness.

But by my love and hope I beseech you: do not throw away the hero in
your soul! Hold holy your highest hope!” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Preachers 0fDea th

There are preachers of death, and the earth is full of people to whom
departure from life must be preached.

The earth is full of the superﬂuous, life is spoiled by the all too many.
May they be lured from this life with the “eternal life!”

“Yellow ones,” so the preachers of death are called, or “black ones.”
But I want to show them to you in still different colors.

There are the terrible ones, who carry the predator about in themselves
and have no choice but lust or self—laceration. And even their lusting is
self—laceration.

They have not even become human beings, these terrible ones: may
they preach departure from life and pass away themselves!

There are the consumptive of the soul: scarcely are they born when
they begin to die and long for the teachings of weariness and resignation.

They would like to be dead and we shall honor their will! Let us beware
of waking these dead and disturbing these living cofﬁns!

31

Thus S polee Zara thustra



They encounter a sick or a very old person or a corpse, and right away
they say “life is refuted!”

But only they are refuted and their eyes, which see only the one face of
existence.

Cloaked in thick melancholy and greedy for the small accidents that
bring death, thus they wait and clench their teeth.

Or again: they reach for candy while mocking their childishness; they
cling to their straw of life and mock the fact that they cling to a straw.

Their wisdom says: “A fool who goes on living, but we are such fools!
And precisely that is the most foolish thing about life!”

“Life is only suffering,” so speak others, and do not lie; then see to it
that you cease. Then see to it that the life that is only suffering ceases!

And let the doctrine of your virtue speak thus: “Thou shalt kill thyselﬂ
Thou shalt steal thyself away!”

“Sex is sin,” say the ones who preach death — “let us step aside and not
beget children!”

“Giving birth is strenuous,” — say the others — “why continue to give
birth? One bears only the unhappy!” And they too are preachers of death.

“Pity is needed,” — so say the third kind. “Take what I have! Take what
I am! All the less does life bind me!”

If they were the pitying kind through and through, they would ruin the
lives of their neighbors. Being evil — that would be their proper goodness.

But they want to get free of life; what do they care that they bind others
still tighter with their chains and gifts!

And you too, for whom life is hectic work and unrest: are you not very
weary of life? Are you not very ripe for the sermon of death?

All of you who are in love with hectic work and whatever is fast, new,
strange — you ﬁnd it hard to bear yourselves, your diligence is escape and
the will to forget yourself.

If you believed more in life, you would hurl yourself less into the
moment. But you do not have enough content in yourselves for waiting —
not even for laziness!

Everywhere sounds the voice of those who preach death: and the earth
is full of people to whom departure from life must be preached.

Or “the eternal life.” It's all the same to me — if only they pass away
quickly!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh War and Warriors

We do not want to be spared by our best enemies, nor by those whom we
love thoroughly. So let me tell you the truth now!

My brothers in war! I love you thoroughly, I am and I was like you.
And I am also your best enemy. So let me tell you the truth now!

I know of the hate and envy of your heart. You are not great enough to
not know hate and envy. So at least be great enough to not be ashamed of
them!

And if you cannot be saints of knowledge, then at least be its warriors.
They are the companions and forerunners of such saintliness.

I see many soldiers: if only I saw many warriors! “Uni—form” one calls
what they wear: if only what they conceal with it were not uni—form!

You should be the kind of men whose eyes always seek an enemy — your
enemy. And with some of you there is a hate at ﬁrst sight.

You should seek your enemy, wage your war and for your thoughts!
And when your thought is defeated, then your honesty should cry out in
triumph even for that!

You should love peace as the means to new wars. And the short peace
more than the long one.

I do not recommend work to you, but struggle instead. I do not rec—
ommend peace to you, but Victory instead. Your work shall be a struggle,
your peace shall be a Victory!

One can be silent and sit still only when one has a bow and arrow;
otherwise there is blabbering and quarreling. Your peace shall be a Victory!

You say it is the good cause that hallows even war? I tell you: it is the
good war that hallows any cause.

War and courage have done more great things than love of one's neigh—
bor. Not your pity but your bravery has rescued the casualties so far.

What is good? you ask. Being brave is good. Let little girls say: “Being
good is what is pretty and stirring at the same time.”

You are called heartless, but your heart is genuine and I love the shame
of your heartiness. You are ashamed of your ﬂood, and others are ashamed
of their ebb.

You are ugly? Well so be it, my brothers! Then don the sublime, the
mantle of the ugly!

And when your soul grows big it becomes mischievous, and there is
sarcasm in your sublimity. I know you.

33

Thus S polee Zara thustra



In sarcasm the mischievous one and the weakling meet. But they mis—
understand one another. I know you.

You may have only those enemies whom you can hate, but not enemies
to despise. You must be proud of your enemy: then the successes of your
enemy are your successes too.

Rebellion — that is the nobility of slaves. Let your nobility be obedience!
Your commanding itself shall be obeying!

To a good warrior “thou shalt” sounds nicer than “I will.” And every—
thing you hold dear you should ﬁrst have commanded to you.

Let your love for life be love for your highest hope, and let your highest
hope be the highest thought of life!

But you shall have your highest thought commanded by me — and it
says: human being is something that shall be overcome.

So live your life of obedience and war! What matters living long! Which
warrior wants to be spared!

I spare you not, I love you thoroughly, my brothers in war! —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the New Idol

Somewhere still there are peoples and herds, but not where we live, my
brothers: here there are states.

State? What is that? Well then, lend me your ears now, for I shall say
my words about the death of peoples.

State is the name of the coldest of all cold monsters. It even lies coldly,
and this lie crawls out of its mouth: “I, the state, am the people.”

This is a lie! The ones who created the peoples were the creators, they
hung a faith and a love over them, and thus they served life.

The ones who set traps for the many and call them “state” are annihi—
lators, they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.

Where there are still peoples the state is not understood, and it is hated
as the evil eye and the sin against customs and rights.

This sign I give you: every people speaks its own tongue of good and
evil — which the neighbor does not understand. It invented its own lan—
guage through customs and rights.

But the state lies in all the tongues of good and evil, and whatever it
may tell you, it lies — and whatever it has, it has stolen.

34

F irst Part



Everything about it is false; it bites with stolen teeth, this biting dog.
Even its entrails are false.

Language confusion of good and evil: this sign I give you as the sign of
the state. Indeed, this sign signiﬁes the will to death! Indeed, it beckons
the preachers of death!

Far too many are born: the state was invented for the superﬂuous!

Just look at how it lures them, the far—too—many! How it gulps and
chews and ruminates them!

“On earth there is nothing greater than I: the ordaining ﬁnger of God
am I” — thus roars the monster. And not only the long—eared and the
shortsighted sink to their knees!

Oh, even to you, you great souls, it whispers its dark lies! Unfortunately
it detects the rich hearts who gladly squander themselves!

Yes, it also detects you, you vanquishers of the old God! You grew
weary in battle and now your weariness still serves the new idol!

It wants to gather heroes and honorable men around itself, this new
idol! Gladly it suns itself in the sunshine of your good consciences — the
cold monster!

It wants to give you everything, if you worship it, the new idol. Thus it
buys the shining of your virtue and the look in your proud eyes.

It wants to use you as bait for the far—too—many! Indeed, a hellish piece
of work was thus invented, a death—horse clattering in the regalia of divine
honors!

Indeed, a dying for the many was invented here, one that touts itself as
living; truly, a hearty service to all preachers of death!

State I call it, where all are drinkers of poison, the good and the bad;
state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad; state, where the
slow suicide of everyone is called — “life.”

Just look at these superﬂuous! They steal for themselves the works
of the inventors and the treasures of the wise: education they call their
thievery — and everything turns to sickness and hardship for them!

Just look at these superﬂuous! They are always sick, they vomit their
gall and call it the newspaper. They devour one another and are not even
able to digest themselves.

Just look at these superﬂuous! They acquire riches and yet they become
poorer. They want power and ﬁrst of all the crowbar of power, much
money — these impotent, impoverished ones!

35

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Watch them scramble, these swift monkeys! They scramble all
over each other and thus drag one another down into the mud and
depths.

They all want to get to the throne, it is their madness — as if happiness
sat on the throne! Often mud sits on the throne — and often too the throne
on mud.

Mad all of them seem to me, and scrambling monkeys and overly
aroused. Their idol smells foul to me, the cold monster: together they all
smell foul to me, these idol worshipers.

My brothers, do you want to choke in the reek of their snouts and
cravings? Smash the windows instead and leap into the open!

Get out of the way of the bad smell! Go away from the idol worship of
the superﬂuous!

Get out of the way of the bad smell! Get away from the steam of these
human sacriﬁces!

Even now the earth stands open for great souls. Many seats are still
empty for the lonesome and twosome, fanned by the fragrance of silent
seas.

An open life still stands open for great souls. Indeed, whoever possesses
little is possessed all the less: praised be a small poverty!

There, where the state ends, only there begins the human being who
is not superﬂuous; there begins the song of necessity, the unique and
irreplaceable melody.

There, where the state euols — look there, my brothers! Do you not see
it, the rainbow and the bridges of the overman? —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Flies ofthe Marleet Plate

Flee, my friend, into your solitude! I see you dazed by the noise of the
great men and stung by the stings of the little.

Wood and cliffknow worthily how to keep silent with you. Be once more
like the tree that you love, the broad—branching one: silent and listening
it hangs over the sea.

Where solitude ends, there begins the market place; and where the
market place begins, there begins too the noise of the great actors and the
buzzing of poisonous ﬂies.

36

F irst Part



In the world even the best things are still worthless without the one per—
son who ﬁrst performs them: the people call these great men performers.

The people little understand what is great, that is: the creator. But they
have a sense for all performers and actors of great things.

The world revolves around the inventors of new values: — it revolves
invisibly. But the people and fame revolve around actors: thus is the course
of the world.

Spirit the actor has, but little conscience of spirit. He always believes
in whatever makes people believe most strongly — believe in him!

Tomorrow he will have a new belief and the day after tomorrow an
even newer one. He has hasty senses, like the people, and a ﬁckle ability
to scent.

To overthrow — to him that means: to prove. To drive insane — to
him that means: to convince. And blood to him is the best of all possible
grounds.

A truth that slips into only the ﬁner ears he calls a lie and nothing.
Indeed, he only believes in gods that make great noise in the world!

The market place is full of pompous jesters — and the people are proud
of their great men! They are the men of the hour.

But the hour presses them, and so they press you. And from you too
they want a Yes or a No. Alas, do you want to set your chair between pro
and contra?

Be without envy on account of these unconditional and pressing types,
you lover of truth! Never before has truth hung on the arm of an
absolutist.

Return to your safety on account of these precipitous types: only in the
market place is one assaulted with Yes? or No?

For all deep wells experience is slow; they must wait long before they
know what fell into their depth.

Away from the market place and fame all greatness takes place; away
from the market place and fame the inventors of new values have lived all
along.

Flee, my friend, into your solitude: I see you stung by poisonous ﬂies.
Flee where raw, strong air blows!

Flee into your solitude! You have lived too long near the small and
the pitiful. Flee their invisible revenge! Against you they are nothing but
revenge.

37

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Do not raise your arm against them anymore! They are innumerable,
and it is not your lot to be a shoo—ﬂy.

Innumerable are these small and pitiful ones; and rain drops and weeds
have sufﬁced to bring down many a proud structure.

You are no stone, but already you have become hollow from many drops.
You will shatter and burst still from many drops.

I see you weary from poisonous ﬂies, torn bloody in a hundred places,
and yet your pride does not even become angered.

They want blood from you in all innocence, their bloodless souls
demand blood — and so they sting away in all innocence.

But you, deep one, you suffer too deeply even from small wounds; and
before you could even heal yourself, the same poisonous worm crawled
across your hand.

You are too proud to slay these sweet—toothed creatures. But beware,
or it will become your doom to bear all their poisonous injustice!

They also buzz around you with their praise; importunity is their
praising! They want the closeness of your skin and your blood.

They ﬂatter you like a god or devil; they snivel before you as before
a god or devil. What's the use! They are sycophants and snivelers and
nothing more.

Often too they give themselves charming airs. But that has always been
the cleverness of cowards; yes, cowards are clever!

They think about you much with their narrow souls — you always give
them pause! Everything that is thought about much gives pause.

They punish you for all your Virtues. What they forgive you thoroughly
are only — your mistakes.

Because you are mild and of just temperament, you say: “They are not
guilty of their petty existence.” But their narrow souls think: “All great
existence is guilty.”

Even when you are mild toward them they still feel despised by you;
and they repay your benefaction with hidden malefactions.

Your wordless pride always contradicts their taste; they jubilate if only
you are modest enough to be vain.

That which we recognize in a person we also inﬂame in him — therefore
beware of the petty!

They feel small before you, and their baseness glimmers and glows at
you in invisible revenge.

Haven't you noticed how often they fall silent when you approach them,
and how their strength abandoned them like the smoke of a dying ﬁre?

Yes my friend, you are the bad conscience of your neighbors, for they
are unworthy of you. Therefore they hate you and would like much to
suck your blood.

Your neighbors will always be poisonous ﬂies; that which is great in
you — that itself must make them more poisonous and ever more ﬂy—like.

Flee, my friend, into your solitude and where raw, strong air blows! It
is not your lot to be a shoo—ﬂy. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Chastity

I love the forest. It is bad to live in the cities; there too many are in heat.

Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer than into the dreams
of a woman in heat?

And just look at these men: their eyes say it — they know nothing better
on earth than to lie with a woman.

There is mud at the bottom of their souls; and watch out if their mud
has spirit too!

If only you were perfect at least as animals! But to animals belongs
innocence.

Do I advise you to kill your senses? I advise you on the innocence of
your senses.

Do I advise you to chastity? In some people chastity is a virtue, but in
many it is almost a vice.

They abstain, to be sure: but the bitch, sensuality, leers with envy out
of everything they do.

Even into the heights of their virtue and all the way into their cold
spirit this beast follows them with its unrest.

And how sweetly the bitch, sensuality, knows how to beg for a piece of
spirit when she is denied a piece of meat!

You love tragedies and everything that makes the heart break? But I am
mistrustful of your bitch.

Your eyes are too cruel for me and they gaze with lust in search of
sufferers. Has your lust not simply disguised itself, and now calls itself

pity?

39

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And this parable too I give to you: not a few who wanted to drive out
their devil went into swine themselves.

Those for whom chastity is difﬁcult should be advised against it, or
else it could become their road to hell — that is, the mud and the heat of
the soul.

Do I speak of dirty things? That is not the worst of it to me.

Not when truth is dirty, but when it is shallow the seeker of knowledge
steps reluctantly into its water.

Indeed, there are chaste people through and through; they are milder
of heart, they laugh more gladly and more richly than you.

They laugh at chastity too and ask: “what is chastity?

Is chastity not folly? But this folly came to us, and not we to it.

We offered this guest hostel and heart: now it dwells with us — may it
stay as long as it wants!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Friehol

“One is always too many around me” — thus thinks the hermit. “Always
one times one — in the long run that makes two!”

I and me are always too eager in conversation: how could I stand it if
there were no friend?

For the hermit the friend is always a third: the third is the cork that
prevents the conversation of the two from sinking into the depths.

Oh, there are too many depths for all hermits. That is why they long
so for a friend and his height.

Our faith in others betrays the areas in which we would like to have
faith in ourselves. Our longing for a friend is our betrayer.

And often one uses love merely to leap over envy. And often one attacks
and makes an enemy in order to conceal that one is open to attack.

“At least be my enemy!” — Thus speaks true respect that does not dare
to ask for friendship.

If one wants a friend, then one must also want to wage war for him:
and in order to wage war, one must he ahle to be an enemy.

One should honor the enemy even in one's friend. Can you step up to
your friend without stepping over to him?

In one's friend one should have one's best enemy. You should be closest
to him in heart when you resist him.

F irst Part



You want to wear no garb before your friend? Is it supposed to be to
your friend's honor that you give yourself to him as you are? But for that
he curses you to the devil!

Whoever makes no secret of himself outrages others; so much reason
do you have to fear nakedness! Indeed, if you were gods then you could
be ashamed of your clothing!

For your friend you cannot groom yourselfbeautifully enough, for you
should be his arrow and longing for the overman.

Have you ever seen your friend sleeping — so that you discover how he
really looks? What after all is the face of your friend? It is your own face,
in a rough and imperfect mirror.

Have you ever seen your friend sleeping? Weren't you startled that your
friend looks as he does? Oh my friend, human being is something that
must be overcome.

The friend should be a master of guessing and keeping silent: you must
not want to see everything. Your dream should reveal to you what your
friend does while waking.

Let your compassion be a guessing, so that you might ﬁrst know whether
your friend wants compassion. Perhaps what he loves in you is your
unbroken eye and the look of eternity.

Let compassion for your friend conceal itself beneath a hard shell, so
that in biting on it you lose a tooth! That way it will have its delicacy and
sweetness.

Are you pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to your friend?
Many cannot loosen their own chains and yet they are a redeemer for the
friend.

Are you a slave? Then you cannot be a friend. Are you a tyrant? Then
you cannot have friends.

All too long a slave and a tyrant have been concealed in woman. That
is why woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knows only love.

In the love of a woman are injustice and blindness toward everything
that she does not love. And even in the knowing love of a woman there is
everywhere still assault and lightning and night next to light.

Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats, and birds.
Or, at best, cows.6

6 Nietzsche‘s bitterness toward women, and especially his View that women are incapable of friend—
ship, were no doubt inﬂuenced by his traumatic experience with Lou Salome, with whom he had

Woman is not yet capable of friendship. But tell me, you men, who then

Oh how repulsive is your poverty, you men, and the stinginess of your

would not be poorer for it.

There is comradeship: may there be friendship!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

On a Thousand and One Goals

Many lands Zarathustra saw and many peoples; thus he discovered many
peoples' good and evil. No greater market place on earth did Zarathustra
ﬁnd than good and evil.

No people could live that did not ﬁrst esteem; but if they want
to preserve themselves, then they must not esteem as their neighbor
esteems.

Much that was called good by this people was called scorn and disgrace
by another: thus I found. Much I found that was called evil here and decked
in purple honors there.

Never did one neighbor understand the other: always his soul was
amazed at his neighbor's delusion and malice.

A tablet of the good hangs over every people. Observe, it is the tablet
of their overcomings; observe, it is the voice of their will to power.

Praiseworthy to them is whatever they consider difﬁcult; what is indis—
pensable and difﬁcult, is called good, and whatever stems from the highest
need and still liberates, the rarest, the most difﬁcult — that is praised as
holy.

Whatever lets them rule and triumph and shine, to the dread and envy
of their neighbor, that they consider as the high, the ﬁrst, the measuring,
the meaning of all things.

Truly, my brother, once you discover a people's need and land and sky
and neighbor, you guess as well the law of their overcomings, and why
they climb on this ladder to their hope.

“Always you shall be the ﬁrst and tower above others: no one shall your
jealous soul love, unless it is the friend” — this is what made the soul of a
Greek tremble: with this he walked the path of greatness.

“Speak the truth and be skilled with the bow and arrow” — this seemed
both dear and difﬁcult to the people from whom my name derives — the
name that is both dear and difﬁcult to me.7

“Honor father and mother and comply with their will down to the roots
of one's soul” — this tablet of overcoming a different people hung over
themselves and became powerful and eternal thereby.

“Practice loyalty and for loyalty's sake risk honor and blood even on evil
and dangerous things” — teaching themselves thus another people con—
quered themselves, and thus conquering themselves they became preg—
nant and heavy with great hopes.

Indeed, humans gave themselves all of their good and evil. Indeed, they
did not take it, they did not ﬁnd it, it did not fall to them as a voice from
heaven.

Humans ﬁrst placed values into things, in order to preserve
themselves — they ﬁrst created meaning for things, a human
meaning!

That is why they call themselves “human,” that is: the esteemer.

Esteeming is creating: hear me, you creators! Esteeming itself is the
treasure and jewel of all esteemed things.

Only through esteeming is there value, and without esteeming the nut
of existence would be hollow. Hear me, you creators!

Change of values — that is the change of creators. Whoever must be a
creator always annihilates.

First peoples were creators and only later individuals; indeed, the indi—
vidual himself is still the youngest creation.

Peoples once hung a tablet of the good over themselves. Love that wants
to rule and love that wants to obey such tablets created together.

7 This is a direct allusion to Zoroaster, Zarathustra‘s namesake: The ancient religion of Zoroastri—
anism is still practiced by some in Iran, formerly called Persia: Nietzsche explains the signiﬁcance
ofusing the German name of Zoroaster for his modern—day prophet in line Homo, ch: 14, section
3, where he writes: “Zarathustra is more truthful than any other thinker: His teaching and it alone
has truthfulness as the supreme Virtue 7 that is, the opposite of the cowardice of the ‘idealist‘ who
ﬂees from reality; Zarathustra has more courage in his body than all thinkers put together: Speak
the truth and he shilleol with the how artol arrow, that is Persian Virtue.” In this passage Nietzsche‘s
three peoples are the Persians, the Jews, and the Germans:

Delight in the herd is older than delight in the ego, and as long as
good conscience is synonymous with herd, only bad conscience says:
ego.

Truly, the sly ego, loveless, wanting its beneﬁt in the beneﬁt of
the many: that is not the origin of the herd, but instead its going
under.

It was always lovers and creators who created good and evil. The ﬁre
of love glows in the names of all virtues and the ﬁre of wrath.

Zarathustra saw many lands and many peoples: no greater power did
Zarathustra ﬁnd on earth than the works of the lovers: “good” and “evil”
are their names.

Truly, a behemoth is the power of this praising and blaming. Tell me,
who will conquer it for me, you brothers? Tell me, who will throw the
fetters over the thousand necks of this beast?

A thousand goals there have been until now, for there have been a
thousand peoples. Only the fetters for the thousand necks are still missing,
the one goal is missing. Humanity still has no goal.

But tell me, my brothers: if humanity still lacks a goal, does it not also
still lack — humanity itself? —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

On Love ofthe Neighhor

You crowd around your neighbor and you have pretty words for it. But I
say to you: your love of the neighbor is your bad love of yourselves.

You ﬂee to your neighbor to escape yourself and you want to make a
virtue of it: but I see through your “selﬂessness.”

The You is older than the I; the You is pronounced sacred, but not yet
the I: and so humans crowd around their neighbors.

Do I recommend love of the neighbor to you? I prefer instead to rec—
ommend ﬂight from the neighbor and love of the farthest!

Higher than love of the neighbor is love of the farthest and the
future; higher still than love of human beings is love of things and
ghosts.

This ghost that runs before you, my brother, is more beautiful than
you; why do you not give it your ﬂesh and your bones? But you are afraid
and run to your neighbor.

F irst Part



You cannot stand yourselves and do not love yourselves enough: now
you want to seduce your neighbor to love and gild yourselves with his
error.

I wish you were unable to stand all these neighbors and their neighbors;
then you would have to create your friend and his overﬂowing heart out
of yourself.

You invite a witness when you want someone to speak well of you; and
when you have seduced him into thinking well of you, you then think well
of yourselves.

Not only he lies who speaks though he knows better, but the real
liar is the one who speaks though he knows nothing. And so you visit
each other and speak of yourselves and deceive your neighbor with
yourselves.

Thus speaks the fool: “The company of people ruins one's character,
especially when one has none.”

One person goes to his neighbor because he seeks himself, and the other
because he would like to lose himself. Your bad love of yourselves makes
your loneliness into a prison.

Those farther away pay for your love of the neighbor; and even when
you are together ﬁve at a time, always a sixth one must die.

Nor do I love your festivals: too many actors I found there, and even
the spectators behaved often like actors.

I do not teach you the neighbor, but the friend. The friend shall be
your festival of the earth and an anticipation of the overman.

I teach you the friend and his overﬂowing heart. But one must under—
stand how to be a sponge, if one wants to be loved by overﬂowing
hearts.

I teach you the friend in whom the world stands complete, a bowl of
goodness — the creating friend who always has a complete world to bestow.

And just as the world rolled apart for him, so it rolled together again in
rings, as the becoming of good through evil, as the becoming of purpose
out of accident.

Let the future and the farthest be the cause of your today: in your friend
you shall love the overman as your cause.

My brothers, I do not recommend love of the neighbor to you: I rec—
ommend love of the farthest to you.

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Way ofthe Creator

Do you want to go into isolation, my brother? Do you want to seek the
way to yourself? Linger a bit longer and listen to me.

“Whoever seeks easily gets lost himself. All isolation is guilt,” thus
speaks the herd. And long have you belonged to the herd.

The voice of the herd will still resonate in you too. And when you will
say “I no longer am of one conscience with you,” then it will be a lament
and a pain.

Behold, this pain itself bore the one conscience, and the last shimmer
of this conscience still glows on your misery.

But you want to go the way of your misery, which is the way to yourself?
Then show me your right and your strength to it!

Are you a new strength and a new right? A ﬁrst movement? A wheel
rolling out of itself? Can you compel even the stars to revolve around you?

Oh, there is so much lust for the heights! There are so many spasms
of the ambitious! Show me that you are not one of the lustful and the
ambitious!

Oh, there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more than a
bellows: they puff up and make emptier.

You call yourself free? Your dominating thought I want to hear, and
not that you escaped from a yoke.8

Are you the kind of person who had the right to escape from a yoke?
There are some who threw away their last value when they threw away
their servitude.

Free from what? What does Zarathustra care! But brightly your eyes
should signal to me: free for what?

Can you give yourself your own evil and good and hang your will above
yourself like a law? Can you be your own judge and the avenger of your
law?

It is terrible to be alone with the judge and avenger of one's own law.
Thus does a star get thrown out into desolate space and into the icy breath
of solitary being.

Today you suffer still from the many, you lonely one: for today you still
have your courage and your hopes intact.

8 joche, yoke, is the same word in German and English: Here Nietzsche speciﬁcally has a yoke in
mind because he is addressing the possibility of freedom among those who are yoked: In “On a

Thousand and One Goals,” Nietzsche uses the word Fesselrt (fetters) in connection with the beast
with a thousand necks, not yoke as indicated in the Kaufmann translation:

But one day solitude will make you weary, one day your pride will
cringe and your courage will gnash its teeth. One day you will cry “I am
alone!”

One day will you will no longer see your high, and your low will be all
too near; your sublimity itself will frighten you like a ghost. One day you
will cry: “Everything is false!”

There are feelings that want to kill the lonely one; if they do not suc—
ceed, well, then they must die themselves! But are you capable of being a
murderer?

Do you know the word “contempt” yet, my brother? And the agony of
your justice, namely to be just to those who despise you?

You compel many to relearn about you; they weigh that heavily against
you. You came near to them and yet passed by: they will never forgive you
that.

You pass over and beyond them, but the higher you climb the smaller
you are to the eyes of envy. But the ones who ﬂy they hate most.

“How would you be just toward me?” — you must say — “I choose your
injustice as my fair share.”

Injustice and ﬁlth they throw at the lonely one. But my brother, if you
want to be a star then you must shine through for them all the more!

And beware of the good and the just! They like to crucify those who
invent their own virtue — they hate the lonely one.

Beware too of holy simplicity! Everything is unholy to it that is not
simple; it also likes to play with ﬁre — the stake.

And beware of the attacks of your love! Too quickly the lonely one
extends his hand to those he encounters.

To some people you should not give your hand, but instead only your
paw: and I want that your paw also has claws.

But the worst enemy whom you can encounter will always be yourself;
you ambush yourself in caves and woods.

Lonely one, you go the way to yourselﬂ And past you yourself leads
your way and past your seven devils!

To your own self you will be heretic and witch and soothsayer and fool
and doubter and unholy man and villain.

You must want to burn yourself up in your own ﬂame: how could you
become new if you did not ﬁrst become ashes!

Lonely one, you go the way of the creator: you will create yourself a
god out of your seven devils!

Lonely one, you go the way of the lover: you love yourself and that is
why you despise yourself as only lovers despise.

The lover wants to create because he despises! What does he know of
love who did not have to despise precisely what he loved!

With your love go into your isolation and with your creativity, my
brother; and only later will justice limp after you.

With my tears go into your isolation, my brother. I love him who wants
to create over and beyond himself and thus perishes. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Little Women 01a and Young

“Why do you creep about so timidly in the twilight, Zarathustra? And
what do you conceal so cautiously beneath your coat?

Is it a treasure that was given to you? Or a child that was born to
you? Or do you yourself now walk the paths of thieves, you friend of the
evil?” —

“Indeed, my brother!” spoke Zarathustra. “It is a treasure that was
given to me: it is a little truth, which I carry.

But it is unruly like a young child, and if I do not hold its mouth shut,
then it cries out too loudly.

As I went my way alone today, at the hour when the sun sets, I met a
little old woman and she spoke thus to my soul:

‘Much has Zarathustra spoken also to us women, and yet he has never
spoken to us about woman.'

And I replied to her: ‘About woman one should speak only to men.'

‘Speak to me too about woman,' she said. ‘I am old enough to forget it
right away.'

And I humored the little old woman and spoke thus to her:

Everything about woman is a riddle, and everything about woman has
one solution: it is called pregnancy.

A man is for woman a means: the end is always the child. But what is
woman for a man?

Two things the real man wants: danger and play. That is why he wants
woman as the most dangerous plaything.

A man should be raised for war and woman for the recreation of the
warrior: everything else is folly.

48

F irst Part



Fruits that are all too sweet — these the warrior does not like. Therefore
he likes woman; even the sweetest woman is still bitter.

Better than a man, woman understands children, but a man is more
childish than a woman.

In the real man a child is concealed: it wants to play. Up now, you
women, go discover the child in the man!

Let woman be a plaything, pure and ﬁne, like a gemstone radiated by
the virtues of a world that does not yet exist.

Let the ray of a star shine in your love! Let your hope be called: ‘May
I give birth to the overman!'

Let courage be in your love! With your love you should throw yourself
at him who makes you afraid!

Let your honor be in your love! Otherwise woman understands little
about honor. But let this be your honor: always to love more than you are
loved, and never to be second.

Let a man be afraid of a woman when she loves; then she makes any
sacriﬁce, and every other thing is without value to her.

Let a man be afraid of a woman when she hates; for at the bottom of
his soul a man is merely evil, but woman is bad there.

Whom does a woman hate most? — Thus spoke the iron to the magnet:
‘I hate you most because you attract, but are not strong enough to attract
me to you.'

The happiness of a man says: I will. The happiness of a woman says:
he wills.

‘Behold, just now the world became perfect!' — Thus thinks every
woman when she obeys out of total love.

And a woman must obey and ﬁnd a depth for her surface. Surface is
a woman's disposition, a ﬂexible, stormy skin over shallow water. But a
man's disposition is deep, his stream roars in underground caves; woman
intuits his strength but does not comprehend it.” —

Then the little old woman replied to me: “Much that is sweet Zarathus—
tra has said, and especially for those who are young enough for it.

Peculiar, though, that Zarathustra knows women only little, and yet he
is right about them! Does this happen because with women nothing is
impossible?

And now, by way of thanks, accept a little truth! Surely I am old enough
for it!

49

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Bundle it up and hold its mouth shut, or else it will cry out too loudly,
this little truth.”

“Give me your little truth, woman!” I said. And thus spoke the little
old woman:

“You go to women? Do not forget the whip!”9 —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Adder's Bite

One day Zarathustra had fallen asleep beneath a ﬁg tree, since it was hot,
and he had laid his arm over his face. Then an adder came along and
bit him in the neck, so that Zarathustra cried out in pain. When he had
taken his arm from his face he looked at the snake; it recognized the eyes
of Zarathustra, turned around awkwardly and tried to get away. “Not
so fast,” spoke Zarathustra. “You have not yet accepted my thanks! You
waked me in time, my way is still long.” “Your way is still short,” said
the adder sadly: “My poison kills.” Zarathustra smiled. “Since when did
a dragon ever die of snake poison?” he said. “But take back your poison!
You are not rich enough to give it to me.” Then the snake fell upon his
neck once again and licked his wound.

When Zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked: “And
what, oh Zarathustra, is the moral of your story?” To which Zarathustra
responded thus:

“The annihilator of morals the good and just call me: my story is
immoral.

If you should have an enemy, then do not requite him evil with good,
for that would shame him. Instead prove that he has does you some good.

And be angry rather than shaming someone! And if you are cursed at,
I do not like it that you want to bless. Better to curse along a bit!

And if a great wrong befell you, then quickly add ﬁve small ones to it!
Ghastly to behold is a person who suffers a wrong all by himself.

Did you know this already? A wrong shared is half a right. And the one
who should take a wrong upon himself is the one who can bear it!

9 Recent scholarship on Nietzsche‘s View of women reveals a deeper appreciation of women than the
one suggested here, which is seductively misleading: In the 1882 photo ofNietzsche, Paul Ree, and
Lou Salome, the two men are “in harness” in front ofa tiny cart, while Lou Salome holds a toy

A small revenge is more humane than no revenge at all. And if the
punishment is not also a right and an honor for the transgressor, then I
do not like your punishing either.

It is more noble to pronounce oneself wrong than to remain right,
especially if one is right. Only one has to be rich enough for that.

I do not like your cold justice; and from the eyes of your judges gazes
always the executioner and his cold steel.

Tell me, where is the justice found that is love with seeing eyes?

Then invent me the kind of love that not only bears all punishment but
also all guilt!

Then invent me the kind of justice that pardons everyone, except the
one who judges!

And do you want to hear this too? In the person who would be thor—
oughly just, even lies become philanthropy.

But how could I want to be thoroughly just! How can I give to each his
own! Let this be enough for me: I give to each my own.

Finally, my brothers, beware of doing wrong to any hermits! How could
a hermit forget? How could he requite?

A hermit is like a deep well. It is easy to throw in a stone; but once it
has sunk to the bottom, tell me: who would fetch it up again?

Beware of offending the hermit! But if you've already done so, well
then, kill him too!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Child and Marriage

I have a question for you alone, my brother: like a plumb bob I cast this
question into your soul, in order to know how deep it is.

You are young and wish for a child and marriage for yourself. But I ask
you: are you a person who has a right to wish for a child?

Are you the victor, the self conqueror, the master of your senses, the
ruler of your virtues? Thus I ask you.

Or do the animal and neediness speak out of your wish? Or loneliness?
Or discord with yourself?

I want your Victory and your freedom to long for a child. You should
build living monuments to your Victory and your liberation.

Your should build over and beyond yourself. But ﬁrst I want you built
yourselves, square in body and soul.

51

Thus S polee Zara thustra



You should not only reproduce, but surproduce! May the garden of
marriage help you to that!

You should create a higher body, a ﬁrst movement, a wheel rolling out
of itself— a creator you should create.

Marriage: that is what I call the will by two for creating the one who is
more than those who created it. Respect for one another I call marriage,
and respect for the one who wills such a willing.

Let this be the meaning and the truth of your marriage. But that which
the far—too—many call marriage, these superﬂuous ones — oh, what do I
call that?

Oh, this poverty of the soul by two! Oh, this ﬁlth of the soul by two!
Oh, this pitiful contentment by two!

Marriage they call all this; and they say their marriages are made in
heaven.

Well, I do not like it, this heaven of the superﬂuous! No, I do not like
them, these animals tangled in the heavenly net!

And may the God stay away from me who limps up to bless what he
has not joined together!

Do not laugh at such marriages! Which child would not have reason to
weep about its parents?

Worthy this man seemed to me, and ripe for the meaning of the earth;
but when I saw his woman, the earth seemed to me a house for the senseless.

Indeed, I wish the earth would quake in convulsions whenever a saint
and a goose mate.

This one went forth like a hero seeking truths, and ﬁnally he bagged
himself a little dressed up lie. He calls it his marriage.

That one was socially reserved and a choosy chooser. But all at once he
ruined his company once and for all: he calls it his marriage.

That one sought a maid with the virtues of an angel. But all at once he
became the maid of a woman and now he even has to turn himself into an
angel.

Cautious I found all buyers now, and all have cunning eyes. But even
the cunning man still buys his wife in a poke.

Many brieffollies — that is what you call love. And your marriage makes
an end of many brief follies, as one long stupidity.

Your love of woman and woman's love of man, oh! If only it were
compassion for suffering and for disguised gods! But mostly it is two
animals discovering each other.

52

But even your best love is merely an ecstatic parable and a painful
smolder. It is a torch that should light you to higher ways.

Over and beyond yourselves you must someday love! Thus learh ﬁrst
to love! And therefore you must drink the bitter cup of your love.

There is bitterness in the cup of even the best love: thus it causes
longing for the overman, thus it causes your thirst, you creator!

Thirst for the creator, arrow and longing for the overman: speak, my
brother, is this your will to marriage?

Holy I pronounce such a will and such a marriage. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Free DeathIO

Many die too late, and some die too early. The doctrine still sounds strange:
“Die at the right time!”

Die at the right time: thus Zarathustra teaches it.

To be sure, how could the person who never lives at the right time ever
die at the right time? Would that he were never born! — Thus I advise the
superﬂuous.

But even the superﬂuous boast about their dying, and even the hollowest
nut still wants to be cracked.

Everyone regards dying as important; but death is not yet a festival.
As of yet people have not learned how to consecrate the most beautiful
festivals.

I show you the consummating death that becomes a goad and a promise
to the living.

The consummated one dies his death, Victorious, surrounded by those
who hope and promise.

Thus one should learn to die; and there should be no festival where
such a dying person does not swear oaths to the living!

To die thus is best; second best, however, is to die ﬁghting and to
squander a great soul.

But your grinning death, the one that creeps up like a thief and yet
comes as master — it is hated as much by the ﬁghter as by the Victor.

1° “Vom freien Tode” 7 on free death 7 suggests oler Freitool, suicide (death entered into freely): As
usual Nietzsche‘s emphasis is on the quality of one‘s life, here juxtaposed with the symbolism of
one‘s death:

Thus S polee Zara thustra



My death I praise to you, the free death that comes to me because I
want.

And when will I want it? — Whoever has a goal and an heir wants death
at the right time for his goal and heir.

And out of reverence for his goal and heir he will no longer hang
withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life.

Indeed, I do not want to be like the rope makers: they stretch out their
threads and in doing so always walk backwards.

Some become too old even for their truths and victories; a toothless
mouth no longer has the right to every truth.

And everyone who wants to have fame must take leave of honor from
time to time and practice the difﬁcult art of leaving — at the right time.

One must stop letting oneself be eaten when one tastes best; this is
known by those who want to be loved for a long time.

There are sour apples, to be sure, whose lot demands that they wait for
the last day of autumn; and immediately they become ripe, yellow and
wrinkled.

With some the heart ages ﬁrst and with others the mind. A few are
hoary in their youth, but the late young stay long young.

For some life fails: a poisonous worm eats its way to their heart. Let
them see to it that their dying succeeds all the more.

Some never become sweet, they rot already in summer. It is cowardice
that keeps them clinging to the branch.

Far too many live and far too long they hang on their branches.
Would that a storm came to shake all this rot and worm—food from the
tree!

Would that preachers of the quiele death came! They would be the right
storms and shakers of the trees of life for me! But I hear only preaching
of the slow death and patience with all things “earthly.”

Indeed, you preach patience with earthly things? It is the earthly things
that have too much patience with you, you slanderers!

Truly, too early did that Hebrew die, the one who is honored by the
preachers of slow death; and for many it has since become their doom that
he died too early.

He still knew only tears and the melancholy of the Hebrews, together
with the hatred of the good and just — the Hebrew Jesus; then longing for
death overcame him.

54

F irst Part



If only he had remained in the desert and far away from the good and
the just! Perhaps he would have learned to live and to love the earth — and
even to laugh!

Believe me, my brothers! He died too early; he himself would have
recanted his teaching if he had reached my age! He was noble enough for
recanting!

But he had not yet matured. A youth loves immaturely, and immaturely
too he hates mankind and earth. Still tethered and heavy to him are his
mind and the wings of his spirit.

But in a man there is more child than in a youth, and less melancholy;
he knows more about death and life.

Free for death and free in death, a sacred nay—sayer when it is no longer
time for yes: thus he knows about death and life.

Do not allow your death to be a slander against mankind and earth, my
friends: that I beseech of the honey of your soul.

In your dying your spirit and your virtue should still glow, like a sunset
around the earth; or else your dying has failed you.

Thus I myself want to die, so that you my friends love the earth more
for my sake; and I want to become earth again, so that I may have peace
in the one who bore me.

Truly, Zarathustra had a goal, he threw his ball. Now you my friends
are the heirs of my goal, to you I throw the golden ball.

More than anything I like to see you, my friends, throwing the golden
ball! And so I linger yet a bit on earth: forgive me that!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Bestowihg VirtueII
1

When Zarathustra had taken leave of the city, which was dear to his heart
and whose name was The Motley Cow, many who called themselves his
disciples followed him, and they provided him escort. Thus they came to
a crossroads; then Zarathustra told them he wanted to walk alone now,
for he was a friend of walking alone. In parting, however, his disciples

“ “Von der schenkenden Tugend,” with schert/eert meaning “to bestow” rather than merely “to
give.” German uses schert/eert to connote the special kind ofgiving as a gift, a present, a grant, or a
donation: “Giving” captures some of this, but German uses gehert (to give) just as English does:

55

Thus S polee Zara thustra



presented him with a staff upon whose golden knob a snake encircled the
sun. Zarathustra was delighted with the staff and leaned on it; then he
spoke thus to his disciples.

Tell me now: how did gold come to have the highest value? Because it
is uncommon and useless and gleaming and mild in its luster; it bestows
itself always.

Only as the image of the highest virtue did gold come to have the
highest value. Goldlike gleams the gaze of the bestower. Golden luster
makes peace between moon and sun.

Uncommon is the highest virtue and useless, it is gleaming and mild
in its luster: a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue.

Truly, I guess you well, my disciples: like me you strive for the bestowing
Virtue. What would you have in common with cats or wolves?

This is your thirst: to become sacriﬁces and gifts yourselves, and there—
fore you thirst to amass all riches in your soul.

Insatiably your soul strives for treasures and gems, because your virtue
is insatiable in wanting to bestow.

You compel all things to and into yourselves, so that they may gush
back from your well as the gifts of your love.

Indeed, such a bestowing love must become a robber of all values, but
hale and holy I call this selﬁshness.

There is another selﬁshness, one all too poor, a hungering one that
always wants to steal; that selﬁshness of the sick, the sick selﬁshness.

With the eye of the thief it looks at all that gleams; with the greed of
hunger it eyes those with ample food; and always it creeps around the
table of the bestowers.

Sickness speaks out of such craving and invisible degeneration; the
thieving greed of this selﬁshness speaks of a diseased body.

Tell me, my brothers: what do we regard as bad and worst? Is it not
degeneration? — And we always diagnose degeneration where the bestowing
soul is absent.

Upward goes our way, over from genus to super—genus.12 But a horror
to us is the degenerating sense which speaks: “Everything for me.”

‘2 Degeneration (Eutarturtg) is based on genus, just as Erttarturtg is based on Art, meaning genus,
species, type, or kind: Nietzsche‘s concern is with the human species, which he sees threatened
by degeneration: Those humans who possess a superabundance of the bestowing Virtue are tran—
sitioning from human (the species orArt) to superhuman (Uher7Art): In Part IV Zarathustra will
again refer speciﬁcally to a new “beautiful species.”

56

F irst Part



Upward ﬂies our sense; thus it is a parable of our body, a parable of
elevation. Such elevation parables are the names of the Virtues.

Thus the body goes through history, becoming and ﬁghting. And the
spirit — what is it to the body? The herald of its ﬁghts and victories,
companion and echo.

Parables are all names of good and evil: they do not express, they only
hint. A fool who wants to know of them!

Pay attention, my brothers, to every hour where your spirit wants to
speak in parables: there is the origin of your Virtue.

There your body is elevated and resurrected; with its bliss it delights
the spirit, which becomes creator and esteemer and lover and benefactor
of all things.

When your heart ﬂows broad and full like a river, a blessing and a danger
to adjacent dwellers: there is the origin of your virtue.

When you are sublimely above praise and blame, and your will wants
to command all things, as the will of a lover: there is the origin of your
virtue.

When you despise pleasantness and the soft bed, and cannot bed down
far enough away from the softies: there is the origin of your Virtue.

When you are the ones who will with a single will, and this turning
point of all need points to your necessity: there is the origin of your virtue.

Indeed, it is a new good and evil! Indeed, a new, deep rushing and the
voice of a new spring!

It is power, this new virtue; it is a ruling thought and around it a wise
soul: a golden sun and around it the snake of knowledge.

2

Here Zarathustra was silent for a while and looked with love at his disci—
ples. Then he continued to speak thus — and his voice had transformed.

Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue!
Let your bestowing love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the
earth! Thus I beg and beseech you.

Do not let it ﬂy away from earthly things and beat against eternal walls
with its wings! Oh, there has always been so much virtue that ﬂew away!

Like me, guide the virtue that has ﬂown away back to the earth — yes,
back to the body and life: so that it may give the earth its meaning, a
human meaning!

S7

Thus S polee Zara thustra



In a hundred ways thus far the spirit as well as virtue has ﬂown away
and failed. Oh, in our body now all this delusion and failure dwells: there
they have become body and will.

In a hundred ways thus far spirit as well as virtue has essayed and
erred. Indeed, human beings were an experiment. Alas, much ignorance
and error have become embodied in us!

Not only the reason of millennia — their madness too breaks out in us.
It is dangerous to be an heir.

Still we struggle step by step with the giant called accident, and over
all humanity thus far nonsense has ruled, the sense—less.

Let your spirit and your virtue serve the meaning of the earth, my
brothers: and the value of all things will be posited newly by you! Therefore
you shall be ﬁghters! Therefore you shall be creators!

Knowingly the body puriﬁes itself; experimenting with knowledge it
elevates itself; all instincts become sacred in the seeker of knowledge; the
soul of the elevated one becomes gay.

Physician, help yourself: thus also you help your sick. Let that
be his best help, that he sees with his own eyes the one who heals
himself.

There are a thousand paths that have never yet been walked; a thousand
healths and hidden islands of life. Human being and human earth are still
unexhausted and undiscovered.

Wake and listen, you lonely ones! From the future come winds with
secretive wingbeats; good tidings are issued to delicate ears.

You lonely of today, you withdrawing ones, one day you shall be a
people: from you who have chosen yourselves a chosen people shall grow —
and from them the overman.

Indeed, the earth shall yet become a site of recovery! And already a new
fragrance lies about it, salubrious — and a new hope!

When Zarathustra had said these words, he grew silent like one who has
not spoken his last word. Long he weighed the staff in his hand, doubtfully.
Finally he spoke thus, and his voice had transformed.

“Alone I go now, my disciples! You also should go now, and alone! Thus
I want it.

Indeed, I counsel you to go away from me and guard yourselves against
Zarathustra! And even better: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he deceived
you.

The person of knowledge must not only be able to love his enemies,
but to hate his friends too.

One repays a teacher badly if one always remains a pupil only. And why
would you not want to pluck at my wreath?

You revere me, but what if your reverence falls down some day? Beware
that you are not killed by a statue!

You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra! You
are my believers, but what matter all believers!

You had not yet sought yourselves, then you found me. All believers
do this; that's why all faith amounts to so little.

Now I bid you lose me and ﬁnd yourselves; and only when you have all
denied me will I return to you.

Indeed, with different eyes, my brothers, will I then seek my lost ones;
with a different love will I love you then.

And one day again you shall become my friends and children of a single
hope; then I shall be with you a third time, to celebrate the great noon
With you.

And that is the great noon, where human beings stand at the midpoint
of their course between animal and overman and celebrate their way to
evening as their highest hope: for it is the way to a new morning.

Then the one who goes under will bless himself, that he is one who
crosses over; and the sun of his knowledge will stand at noon for him.

‘Deaa are all gods: how we want the overman to live.' — Let this be our
last will at the great noon!” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Chilol with the Mirror

At this time Zarathustra returned again to the mountains and to the
solitude of his cave and withdrew from mankind, waiting like a sower
who has cast his seeds. But his soul grew full of impatience and desire for
those whom he loved, because he still had much to give them. For this is
the hardest thing: to close the open hand out of love, and to preserve a
sense of shame as a bestower.

Thus moons and years passed for the lonely one; but his wisdom grew
and its fullness caused him pain.

But one morning he woke already before dawn, reﬂected for a long time
on his bed and at last spoke to his heart:

What frightened me so in my dream that it waked me? Did not a child
approach me carrying a mirror?

“Oh Zarathustra” — spoke the child to me — “look at yourself in the
mirror!”

But when I looked into the mirror I cried out, and my heart was shaken;
for I did not see myself there, but a devil's grimace and scornful laughter.

Indeed, all too well I understand the dream's sign and warning: my
teaching is in danger, weeds want to be wheat!

My enemies have become powerful and have distorted the image of my
teaching, so that those dearest to me must be ashamed of the gifts I gave
them.

My friends are lost to me; the hour has arrived to seek my lost ones! —

With these words Zarathustra leaped to his feet, but not like a fright—
ened person ﬁghting for air, but instead more like a seer and a singer on
whom the spirit has descended. In amazement his eagle and his snake
looked at him, for like the dawn an impending happiness lay upon his
face.

What just happened to me, my animals? — said Zarathustra. Am I not
transformed? Did bliss not come to me like a storm wind?

Foolish is my happiness and it will speak foolish things: it is still too
young — so have patience with it!

I am wounded by my happiness: all sufferers shall be physicians to me!

Once again I may descend to my friends and also to my enemies!
Zarathustra may speak again and bestow and do what he loves best for
loved ones!

Thus S polee Zara thustra



My impatient love ﬂoods over in torrents, downward, toward sunrise
and sunset. From silent mountains and thunderheads of pain my soul
roars into the valleys.

Too long have I longed and gazed into the distance. Too long I belonged
to solitude — thus I forgot how to be silent.

I have become mouth through and through, and a brook's bound—
ing from high boulders: I want to plunge my speech down into the
valleys.

And may my torrent of love plunge into impasses! How could a torrent
not ﬁnally make its way to the sea!

Truly, there is a lake in me, a hermit—like and self—sufﬁcient lake; but
my torrent of love tears it along — down to the sea!

New ways I go, a new speech comes to me; I became weary, like all
creators, of old tongues. My spirit no longer wants to wander on worn
soles.

All speech runs too slowly for me: — I leap into your chariot, storm!
And I shall whip even you with the whip of my malice!

Like a shout and a jubilation I want to journey over broad seas until I
ﬁnd the blessed isles where my friends dwell —

And my enemies among them! How I love everyone now, with whom
I may simply speak! Even my enemies belong to my bliss.

And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then my spear always
helps me up best: it is the ever—ready servant of my foot —

The spear I hurl against my enemies! How I thank my enemies that at
last I may hurl it!

Too great was the tension of my cloud: between lightning peals of
laughter I shall throw hail showers into the depths.

Violently my chest will heave then, violently it will blow its storm over
mountains: thus relief comes to it.

Indeed, my happiness and my freedom come like a storm! But my
enemies should believe the evil one is raging over their heads.

Indeed, you too will be frightened, my friends, because of my wild
wisdom; and perhaps you will ﬂee from it together with my enemies.

Oh, if only I understood how to lure you back with shepherds' ﬂutes!
Oh, if only my lioness—wisdom could learn to roar tenderly! And much
we have already learned with each other!

My wild wisdom wound up pregnant on lonely mountains; on naked
stones she bore her young, her youngest.

Now she runs foolishly through harsh desert and seeks and seeks gentle
turf — my old wild wisdom!

Upon the gentle turf of your hearts, my friends! — upon your love she
would like to bed her most beloved!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Blessed Isles

The ﬁgs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and as they fall, their
red skin ruptures. I am a north wind to ripe ﬁgs.

Thus, like ﬁgs, these teachings fall to you, my friends: now drink their
juice and their sweet ﬂesh! It is autumn all around and pure sky and
afternoon.

See what fullness is around us! And from such superabundance it is
beautiful to look out upon distant seas.

Once people said God when they gazed upon distant seas; but now I
have taught you to say: overman.

God is a conjecture, but I want that your conjecturing not reach further
than your creating will.

Could you create a god? — Then be silent about any gods! But you could
well create the overman.

Not you yourselves perhaps, my brothers! But you could recreate your—
selves into fathers and forefathers of the overman: and this shall be your
best creating! —

God is a conjecture: but I want your conjecturing to be limited to what
is thinkable.

Could you thihle a God? — But let this mean will to truth to you; that
everything be transformed into what is humanly thinkable, humanly
visible, humanly feelable! You should think your own senses to their
conclusion!

And what you called world, that should ﬁrst be created by you: your
reason, your image, your will, your love itself it should become! And truly,
for your own bliss, you seekers of knowledge!

And how would you bear life without this hope, you seekers of
knowledge? Neither into the incomprehensible nor into the irrational
could you have been born.

But to reveal my entire heart to you, my friends: if there were gods,
how could I stand not to be a god! Therefore there are no gods.

65

Thus S polee Zara thustra



I drew this conclusion to be sure; but now it draws me. —

God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the agony of this conjecture
without dying? Should the creating person's faith be taken, and from the
eagle its soaring in eagle heights?

God is a thought that makes crooked everything that is straight, and
causes everything that stands to turn. What? Should time be gone, and
all that is not everlasting be merely a lie?

To think this causes whirling and dizziness to human bones and even
vomiting to the stomach: indeed, the turning disease I call it, to conjecture
such things.

Evil I call it and misanthropic: all this teaching of the one and the
plenum and the unmoved and the sated and the everlasting!

All that is everlasting — that is merely a parable! And the poets lie too
much.

But the best parables should speak about time and becoming: they
should be praise and justiﬁcation of all that is not everlasting!

Creating — that is the great redemption from suffering, and life's becom—
ing light. But in order for the creator to be, suffering is needed and much
transformation.

Indeed, much bitter dying must be in your life, you creators! Therefore
you are advocates and justiﬁers of all that is not everlasting.

In order for the creator himself to be the child who is newly
born, he must also want to be the birth—giver and the pain of giving
birth.

Indeed, through a hundred souls I went my way and through a hundred
cradles and pangs of birth. Many a farewell have I taken already; I know
the heartbreaking ﬁnal hours.

But thus my creating will wills it, my destiny. Or, to tell it more honestly
to you: just such a destiny — my will wills.

Everything that feels, suffers in me and is in prison; but my will always
comes to me as my liberator and bringer of joy.

Willing liberates: that is the true teaching of will and liberty — thus
Zarathustra teaches it.

No more willing and no more esteeming and no more creating! Oh, if
only this great weariness would always keep away from me!

Even in knowing I feel only my Will's lust to beget and to become; and
if there is innocence in my knowledge, then this happens because the will
to beget is in it.

66

Second Part



Away from God and gods this will lured me; what would there be to
create, after all, if there were gods?

But I am always driven anew to human beings by my ardent will to
create; thus the hammer is driven toward the stone.

Oh you human beings, in the stone sleeps an image, the image of my
images! A shame it must sleep in the hardest, ugliest stone!

Now my hammer rages cruelly against its prison. Shards shower from
the stone: what do I care?

I want to perfect it, for a shadow came to me — the Stillest and lightest
of all things once came to me!

The overman's beauty came to me as a shadow. Oh, my brothers! Of
what concern to me anymore — are gods! —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Pityihg

My friends, a gibe was told to your friend: “Just look at Zarathustra! Does
he not wander among us like we were animals?”

But it is better said this way: “The seeker of knowledge wanders among
human beings as among animals.”

Human beings themselves, however, the seeker of knowledge calls: the
animal that has red cheeks.

How did this happen? Is it not because they have had to be ashamed so
often?

Oh my friends! Thus speaks the seeker of knowledge: Shame, shame,
shame — that is the history of human beings!

And that is why the noble person commands himself not to shame;
shame he demands of himself before all sufferers.

Indeed, I do not like them, the merciful who are blissful in their pitying:
they lack too much in shame.

If I must be pitying, then I certainly do not want to be called such; and
if I am, then preferably from a distance.

Gladly would I cover my head and ﬂee before I am recognized, and
thus I bid you do as well, my friends!

May my destiny always lead those like you, who do not suffer, across
my path, and those with whom I may share hope and meal and honey!

Indeed, I probably did this and that for sufferers, but I always seemed
to do myself better when I learned to enjoy myself better.

67

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Ever since there have been humans, the human being has enjoyed
himselftoo little: That alone, my brothers, is our original sin!

And if we learn to enjoy ourselves better, then we forget best how to
hurt others and plot hurt for them.

Therefore I wash the hand that helped the sufferer, therefore too I wipe
even my soul.

For inasmuch as I saw the sufferer suffering, I was ashamed for the sake
of his shame; and when I helped him I severely violated his pride.

Great indebtedness does not make people thankful, but vengeful
instead; and if the small kindness is not forgotten then it will become
a gnawing worm.

“Be cold in accepting! Let your accepting serve to distinguish!” — Thus
I counsel those who have nothing to give away.

I, however, am a bestower. Gladly I bestow as friend to friends. But
strangers and poor people may pluck the fruit from my tree themselves:
that way there is less shame.

But beggars should be abolished completely! Indeed, one is angered in
giving and angered in not giving to them.

And the same for sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends,
bites of conscience teach people to bite.

Worst, however, are petty thoughts. Indeed, better to do evil than to
think small!

You say, to be sure: “Pleasure in small mischief saves us many a great
evil deed.” But here one should not want to save.

An evil deed is like a sore: it itches and scratches and ruptures — it
speaks honestly.

“Behold, I am sickness” — thus speaks the evil deed, that is its honesty.

But a petty thought is like a fungus; it creeps and crouches and does
not want to be anywhere — until the whole body is rotten and wilted with
little fungi.

To the one who is possessed by the devil, however, I whisper these
words in his ear: “Better to raise your devil until it is big! Even for you
there is still a way to greatness!” —

Oh my brothers! One knows a bit too much about everyone! And though
some become transparent to us, we can by no means pass through them
on that account.

It is difﬁcult to live with people because remaining silent is so difﬁcult.

68

And we are not most unfair toward those who are repugnant to us, but
toward those who do not at all concern us.

But if you have a suffering friend, then be a resting place to his suffering,
yet at the same time a hard bed, a camp bed: thus you will be most useful
to him.

And if a friend does evil to you, then say: “I forgive you what you
have done to me; but that you did it to yourself— how could I forgive
that!”

Thus speaks all great love; it overcomes even forgiveness and pitying.

One should hold on ﬁrmly to one's heart, for if one lets it go, how
quickly one then loses one's head!

Oh, where in the world has greater folly occurred than among the
pitying? And what in the world causes more suffering than the folly of
the pitying?

Woe to all lovers who do not yet have an elevation that is above their
pitying!

Thus the devil once spoke to me: “Even God has his hell: it is his love
for mankind.”

And recently I heard him say these words: “God is dead; God died of
his pity for mankind.”

Thus I warn you against pity: from it a heavy cloud is coming to
mankind! Indeed, I understand weather forecasting!

But note these words too: all great love is above even all its pitying, for
it still wants to create the beloved!

“I offer myself to my love, anal my ueighhor as myself” — thus it is said
of all creators.

But all creators are hard. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Priests

And once Zarathustra gave a sign to his disciples and spoke these words
to them:

“Here are priests, and though they are my enemies, go quietly past
them and with sleeping swords!

Among them too there are heroes; many of them suffered too much, so
they want to make others suffer.

69

Thus S polee Zara thustra



They are evil enemies: nothing is more vengeful than their humility.
And whoever attacks them is easily besmirched.

But my blood is related to theirs, and I want to know that my blood is
honored even in theirs.”

And when they had passed by Zarathustra was seized by pain; and not
long had he wrestled with his pain when he rose and began to speak thus:

“I feel for these priests. And though I also ﬁnd them distasteful, that
is the least of my concerns since I have been among human beings.

But I suffer and suffered with them; to me they are prisoners and
marked men. The one they call redeemer clapped them in irons: —

In irons of false values and words of delusion! Oh that someone would
yet redeem them from their redeemer!

Once they believed they landed on an island as the sea tossed them
around; but see, it was a sleeping monster!

False values and words of delusion: these are the worst monsters for
mortals — long does doom sleep and wait in them.

But at last it comes and wakes and devours and gulps whatever built
itself huts upon it.

Oh look at these huts that the priests built themselves! Churches they
call their sweet smelling caves.

Oh how repulsive is this falsiﬁed light, this stale air! Here, where the
soul to its height — is denied ﬂight!

Instead their faith commands: ‘Up the stairs on your knees, you
sinners!'

Indeed, I would rather see the shameless than the rolled back eyes of
their shame and devotion!

Who created such caves and stairs of penitence? Were they not those
who wanted to hide and were ashamed beneath the pure sky?

And only when the pure sky peeks again through broken ceilings and
down upon grass and red poppy and broken walls — only then will I turn
my heart again to the sites of this God.

They called God what contradicted and hurt them, and truly, there
was much heroics in their adoration!

And they knew no other way to love their God than to nail the human
being to a cross!

They intended to live as corpses, they decked out their corpse in black;
from their speeches I still smell the rotten spice of death chambers.

And whoever lives near them lives near black ponds, out of which the
toad sings its song with sweet melancholy.

Better songs they will have to sing for me before I learn to believe in
their redeemer; more redeemed his disciples would have to look!

I would like to see them naked, for beauty alone should preach peni—
tence. But who is persuaded anyway by this masked gloom!

Indeed, their redeemers themselves did not come from freedom and
the freedom of seventh heaven! Indeed, they themselves never walked on
the carpets of knowledge!

The spirit of these redeemers consisted of gaps; but into every
gap they had plugged a delusion, their stopgap, whom they named
God.

Their spirit drowned in their pitying, and when they swelled and over—
swelled with pity, always a great folly ﬂoated on top.

Zealously and with shouting they drove their herd along their path, as
if there were only one path to the future! Indeed, these shepherds, too,
still belonged among the sheep!

Small spirits and roomy souls these shepherds had, but my brothers;
what small countries even the roomiest souls have been so far!

Blood—signs they wrote along the way that they walked, and their folly
taught that one proves the truth with blood.

But blood is the worst witness of truth; blood poisons even the purest
teaching into delusion and hatred of the heart.

And if someone goes through ﬁre for his teaching — what does this
prove? Indeed, it means more when one's own teaching comes out of
one's own ﬁre!

A sultry heart and a cold head: where these come together the howling
wind originates, the ‘redeemer.'

There have been greater ones, to be sure, and higher born than those
whom the people call redeemers, these sweeping howling winds!

And you must be redeemed even from those greater than all redeemers,
my brothers, if you want to ﬁnd your way to freedom!

Never yet has there been an overman. Naked I saw both, the greatest
and the smallest human being —

All too similar they are to one another. Truly, even the greatest I
found — all too human!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

71

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Oh the Virtuous

With thunder and heavenly ﬁreworks one must speak to slack and sleeping
senses.

But the voice of beauty speaks softly; it creeps only into the most
awakened souls.

Softly today my shield trembled and laughed; it is the holy laughter
and trembling of beauty.

At you, Virtuous ones, my beauty laughed today. And thus its voice
came to me: “They still want — to be paid!”

You still want to be paid, you Virtuous! Want to have reward for virtue,
and heaven for earth, and eternity for your today?

And now you're angry with me for teaching that there is no reward and
paymaster? And truly, I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward.

Oh, this is my sorrow; reward and punishment have been lied into
the ground of things — and now even into the ground of your souls, you
Virtuous!

But like the snout of a boar my words shall tear open the ground of
your souls; a plowshare I shall be to you.

All the secrets of your ground shall be brought to light; and when you
lie uprooted and broken in the sun, your lie also will be separated from
your truth.

For this is your truth: you are too pure for the ﬁlth of the words revenge,
punishment, reward, retribution.

You love your virtue as the mother her child; but when did anyone ever
hear that a mother wanted to be paid for her love?

Your virtue is your dearest self. The ring's thirst is in you; every ring
struggles and turns to reach itselfagain.

And each work of your virtue is like the star that dies out; always its
light is still on its way and wandering — and when will it no longer be on
its way?

Thus the light of your virtue is still underway, even when the work is
done. And even if now forgotten and dead, its ray of light still lives and
wanders.

Your virtue should be your self and not a foreign thing, a skin, a cloaking:
that is the truth from the ground of your soul, you Virtuous! —

But surely there are those who equate virtue with spasm under a whip,
and you have listened too much to their cries!

72

Second Part



And there are others who call it virtue when their vices grow lazy; and
when their hatred and their jealousy stretch their limbs for once, their
“justice” perks up and rubs its sleepy eyes.

And there are others who are pulled down, their devil pulls them. But
the more they sink the more ardently glow their eyes and the craving for
their god.

Oh, their cries too penetrated your ears, you Virtuous: “What I am not,
that, that is God and virtue to me!”

And there are others who come along heavy and creaking like wagons
carting stones downhill: they speak much of dignity and virtue — they call
their brake virtue!

And there are others who are like run of the mill clocks that have been
wound up: they go tick—tock and want to have their tic called virtue.

Indeed, I have my fun with these; wherever I ﬁnd such clocks I will
wind them up with my mockery, and make them whir for me!

And others are proud of their handful of justice, and for its sake they
commit outrage against all things, such that the world is drowned in their
injustice.

Oh, how foul the word “virtue” sounds coming from their mouths!
And when they say: “I am just,” then it sounds always like: “I am just
avenged!”

With their virtue they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies;
and they elevate themselves only to degrade others.

And then again there are those who sit in their swamp and speak
thus from out of the reeds: “Virtue — that means sitting quietly in the
swamp.

We bite no one and avoid anyone who wants to bite; and in all matters
we have that opinion that is given us.”

And then again there are those who love gestures and think: virtue is a
kind of gesture.

Their knees always adore and their hands are extolments of virtue, but
their hearts know nothing of it.

And then again there are those who consider it virtue to say: “Virtue is
necessity”; but at bottom they believe only that the police are a necessity.

And some who cannot see the high in people call it virtue that they see
the low all too near, thus they call their evil eye virtue.

And a few want to be ediﬁed and built up and call that virtue; and
others want to be toppled — and call that virtue too.

73

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And in this manner almost all believe they have a share of Virtue;
and at the very least each person wants to be an expert on “good” and
“evil.”

But Zarathustra has not come to say to all these liars and fools: “What
do you know about virtue! What eoulol you know about virtue!” —

Instead, my friends, I wish you would grow weary of the old words you
have learned from the fools and liars:

Grow weary of the words “reward,” “retribution,
“revenge in justice” —

Grow weary of saying: “What makes a deed good is that it is selﬂess.”

Oh my friends! I wish your self were in the deed like the mother is in
the child: let that be your word on virtue!

Indeed, I may have taken from you a hundred words and your Virtue's
favorite toys; and now you are angry with me as children become angry.

They played by the sea — then the wave came and tore their toys into
the deep: now they weep.

But the same wave shall bring them new toys and lavish new colorful
shells before them!

Thus will they be consoled; and like them you, too, my friends shall
have your consolations — and new colorful shells! —

” “punishment,”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Rahhle

Life is a well of joy; but where the rabble also drinks, there all wells are
poisoned.

I appreciate all that is clean; but I do not like to see the grinning snouts
and the thirst of the unclean.

They cast their eyes down into the well; now their disgusting smile
reﬂects back up to me from the well.

They have poisoned the holy water with their lustfulness; and when
they called their ﬁlthy dreams joy, they poisoned even words.

The ﬂame shrinks when they put their dank hearts on the ﬁre; the spirit
itself seethes and smokes wherever the rabble approaches the ﬁre.

In their hands fruits becomes sickly sweet and overripe; their gaze
makes fruit trees prone to windfall and withered at the crown.

And some who turned away from life only turned away from the rabble,
not wanting to share well and ﬂame and fruit with the rabble.

And some who went into the wilderness and suffered thirst with beasts
of prey simply did not want to sit around the cistern with ﬁlthy camel
drivers.

And some who came along like annihilators and like a hailstorm to all
orchards merely wanted to plant their foot into the maw of the rabble to
stuff its throat.

And the bite I gagged on most was not the knowledge that life itself
requires hostility and dying and torture crosses —

Instead I once asked, and almost choked on my question: What? Does
life also require the rabble?

Are poisoned wells and stinking ﬁres and soiled dreams and maggots
required in life's bread?

Not my hatred but my nausea fed hungrily on my life! Oh, I often grew
weary of the spirit when I found even the rabble had wit!

And I turned my back on the rulers when I saw what they call ruling
today: haggling and bartering for power — with the rabble!

Among peoples of foreign tongues I lived, with my ears closed, so
that the haggling of their tongue and their bartering for power would
remain foreign to me. And holding my nose I walked annoyed through
all yesterday and today; truly, all yesterday and today smell foul of the
writing rabble!

Like a cripple who became deaf and blind and dumb; thus I lived for
a long time, so as not to live with the power—, the scribble—, the pleasure—
rabble.

Laboriously my spirit climbed steps, and cautiously; alms of joy were
its refreshment; for the blind man life crept by as if on a cane.

But what happened to me? How did I redeem myself from nausea?
Who rejuvenated my eyes? How did I manage to ﬂy to the height where
no more rabble sits at the well?

Did my nausea itself create wings for me and water—divining powers?
Truly, into the highest regions I had to ﬂy in order to rediscover the
wellspring of joy!

Oh I found it, my brothers! Here in the highest regions the wellspring
of joy gushes for me! And there is a life from which no rabble drinks!

Almost too forcefully you ﬂow, well of joy! And often you empty the
cup again in wanting to ﬁll it!

And I must still learn to approach you more modestly; all too forcefully
my heart still streams toward you —

superblissful summer; how my summer heart yearns for your coolness!

Gone the hesitating gloom of my spring! Gone the malice of my
snowﬂakes in June! I have become summer and summer noon entirely!

A summer in the highest regions with cold springs and blissful silence:
Oh come, my friends, and let the silence become even more blissful!

For it is our height and our homeland; too high and steep we live here
for all the unclean and their thirst.

Cast your pure eyes into the wellspring of my joy, you friends! How
could it become murky from that! It shall laugh back at you with its purity.

We build our nest in the tree called future; eagles shall bring us solitary
ones food in their beaks!

Truly, no food in which the unclean are allowed to share! They would
think they were devouring ﬁre and burn their snouts!

Truly, we keep no homesteads ready here for the unclean! To their
bodies and to their minds our happiness would seem a cave of ice!

And like strong winds we want to live above them, neighbors to eagles,
neighbors to snow, neighbors to the sun: thus live strong winds.

And some day I want to blow among them like a wind and steal their
breath away with my spirit: thus my future wills it.

Indeed, Zarathustra is a strong wind to all lowlands; and this counsel
he gives to his enemies and to everything that spits and spews: “Beware
of spitting a gaiust the wind!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Tarantulas

Look here, this is the hole of the tarantula! Do you want to see the tarantula

Here it comes, willingly — welcome, tarantula! On your back your tri—

Revenge sits in your soul: wherever you bite, there black scabs grow;
your poison makes the soul whirl with revenge!

So I speak to you in parables, you who cause the souls to whirl, you
preachers of equality! Tarantulas you are to me and hidden avengers!

But I want to expose your hiding places to the light; therefore I laugh

word “justice.” For that mahleihol he redeemed from revenge: that to me is
the bridge to the highest hope and a rainbow after long thunderstorms.

But the tarantulas want it otherwise, to be sure. “That the world become
full of the thunderstorms of our revenge, precisely that we would regard
as justice,” — thus they speak with one another.

“We want to exact revenge and heap insult on all whose equals we are
not” — thus vow the tarantula hearts.

“And ‘will to equality' — that itself from now on shall be the name for
Virtue; and against everything that has power we shall raise our clamor!”

You preachers of equality, the tyrant's madness of impotence cries thus
out of you for “equality”: your secret tyrant's cravings mask themselves
thus in your words of virtue!

Aggrieved conceit, repressed envy, perhaps the conceit and envy of
your fathers: it erupts from you like a ﬂame and the madness of revenge.

What is silent in the father learns to speak in the son; and often I found
the son to be the father's exposed secret.

They resemble the inspired, but it is not the heart that inspires them —
but revenge. And when they are reﬁned and cold, it is not the spirit but
envy that makes them reﬁned and cold.

Their jealousy even leads them along the thinkers' path; and this is the
mark of their jealousy — they always go too far, such that their exhaustion
must ultimately lay itself to sleep in snow.

From each of their laments revenge sounds, in each of their praisings
there is harm, and being the judge is bliss to them.

But thus I counsel you my friends: mistrust all in whom the drive to
punish is strong!

Those are people of bad kind and kin; in their faces the hangman and
the bloodhound are visible.

Mistrust all those who speak much of their justice! Indeed, their souls
are lacking not only honey.

And when they call themselves “the good and the just,” then do not
forget that all they lack to be pharisees is — power!

My friends, I do not want not be mixed in with and mistaken for others.

There are those who preach my doctrine of life, and at the same time
they are preachers of equality and tarantulas.

77

Thus S polee Zara thustra



They speak in favor of life, these poisonous spiders, even though they
are sitting in their holes and have turned against life, because they want
to do harm.

They want to harm those who hold power today, for among them the
sermon on death is still most at home.

If it were otherwise, then the tarantulas would teach otherwise; and they
after all were formerly the best world slanderers and burners of heretics.

I do not want to be mixed in with and mistaken for these preachers of
equality. For thus justice speaks to me: “humans are not equal.”

And they shouldn't become so either! What would my love for the
overman be if I spoke otherwise?

On a thousand bridges and paths they shall throng to the future, and
ever more war and inequality shall be set between them: thus my great
love commands me to speak!

Inventors of images and ghosts shall they become in their hostility, and
with their images and ghosts they shall yet ﬁght the highest ﬁght against
each other!

Good and evil, and rich and poor, and high and triﬂing, and all the
names of values: they shall be weapons and clanging signs that life must
overcome itself again and again!

Life itself wants to build itself into the heights with pillars and steps; it
wants to gaze into vast distances and out upon halcyon beauties — therefore
it needs height!

And because it needs height, it needs steps and contradiction between
steps and climbers! Life wants to climb and to overcome itself by climbing.

And look here, my friends! Here, where the tarantula's hole is, the ruins
of an ancient temple are rising — look here now with enlightened eyes!

Indeed, the one who once heaped his thoughts Skyward here in
stone — he knew the secret of all life like the most wise!

That struggle and inequality and war for power and supremacy are
found even in beauty: he teaches us that here in the clearest parable.

How divinely the vault and the arch bend and break each other as they
wrestle; how they struggle against each other with light and shadow, these
divinely struggling ones —

In this manner sure and beautiful let us also be enemies, my friends!
Divinely let us struggle a gaiust each other!

Alas! Then the tarantula bit me, my old enemy! Divinely sure and
beautiful it bit me on the ﬁnger!

“Punishment and justice must be” — thus it thinks. “Not for nothing
shall he sing his songs in honor of hostility here!”

Yes, it has avenged itself! And alas! Now it will also make my soul whirl
with revenge!

But so that I do not whirl, my friends, bind me fast to this pillar here!
I would rather be a stylite than a whirlwind of revenge!

Indeed, Zarathustra is no tornado or whirlwind; and if he is a dancer,
nevermore a tarantella dancer! —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Famous Wise Men

The people you have served and the people's superstition, all you famous
wise men! — and hot the truth! And precisely on that account you were
accorded respect.

And for this reason too they tolerated your lack of faith, because it was
a joke and a jog to the people. Thus does the master allow his slaves to
have their way, delighting all the while in their frolicking.

But whoever is despised by the people like a wolf by dogs; this is the
free spirit, the foe of fetters, the non—adorer, the one who houses in the
woods.

Hunting him out of his lair — to the people this has always meant “a
sense of what is right.” On him the people have always sicced their dogs
with the sharpest teeth.

“For the truth is here if only the people are here! Woe, woe to the
seekers!” — Thus it has echoed for all time.

You wanted to justify your people's reverence; that is what you called
“will to truth,” you famous wise men!

And your heart always said to itself: “From the people I came: from
there too God's voice came to me.”

As advocates of the people you were always stiff—necked and clever, like
asses.

And many a powerful one who wanted to travel well with the people
harnessed a little ass in front of his horses, a famous wise man.

And now, you famous wise men, I wish you would ﬁnally throw off the
lion skin completely!

The mottled skin of the predator, and the mane of the explorer, the
searcher, the conqueror!

79

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Oh, before I would learn to believe in your “truthfulness” you would
ﬁrst have to break your revering will.

Truthful — thus I call the one who goes into godless deserts and has
broken his revering heart.

In the yellow sand and burned by the sun he may squint thirstily at
islands rich with springs, where living things rest beneath dark trees.

But his thirst does not persuade him to become the same as these
comfortable ones; for where there are oases, there are idols as well.

Hungry, violent, lonely, godless; thus the lion—will wants itself.

Free from the happiness of the servant, redeemed of gods and ado—
rations, fearless and fearsome, great and lonely; thus is the will of the
truthful.

In the desert the truthful have always dwelled, the free spirits, as the
rulers of the desert; but in the cities dwell the well—fed, famous wise
men — the draft animals.

For they, as asses, always pull — the people's cart!

Not that I am angry with them for it; but to me they remain servants
and harnessed, even if they gleam in golden harnesses.

And often they were good servants and praiseworthy. For virtue speaks
thus: “If you must serve, then seek the one who beneﬁts most from your
service!

The spirit and virtue of your master shall grow from your being his
servant; thus you yourself grow with his spirit and his Virtue!”

And truly, you famous wise men, you servants of the people! You your—
selves grew with the people's spirit and virtue — and the people through
you! I say this in your honor!

But to me you remain the people even in your virtues, the people with
stupid eyes — the people who don't know what spirit is!

Spirit is life that itself cuts into life; by its own agony it increases its
own knowledge — did you know that?

And the happiness of spirit is this: to be anointed and consecrated by
tears to serve as a sacriﬁcial animal — did you know that?

And the blindness of the blind, and his seeking and probing shall yet
testify to the power of the sun into which he gazed — did you know that?

And the seeker of knowledge shall learn to huilol with mountains! It
means little that the spirit moves mountains — did you know that?

You know only the spark of the spirit, but you do not see the anvil that
it is, nor the cruelty of its hammer!

Indeed, you do not know the pride of the spirit! But even less would
you be able to bear the Spirit's modesty, if it ever wanted to speak!

And never yet have you been permitted to throw your spirit into a pit
of snow; you are not hot enough for that! And so you do not know the
thrills of its coldness.

But in all things you act too familiarly with the spirit, and wisdom you
often make into a poorhouse and hospital for bad poets.

You are no eagles, thus you have not experienced the happiness in the
terror of the spirit. And whoever is not a bird should not build nests over
abysses.

To me you are lukewarm, but every deep knowledge ﬂows cold. Ice—
cold are the innermost wells of the spirit, invigorating for hot hands and
human doers.

Honorable you stand there, and stiff with ramrod backs, you famous
wise men! — You are not driven by strong wind and will.

Have you never seen a sail go over the sea, rounded and billowed and
trembling with the vehemence of the wind?

Like the sail, trembling with the vehemence of the spirit, my wisdom
goes over the sea — my wild wisdom!

But you servants of the people, you famous wise men — how eoulol you
go with me! —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Night Song

It is night: now all fountains speak more loudly. And my soul too is a
fountain.

It is night: only now all the songs of the lovers awaken. And my soul
too is the song of a lover.

An unstilled, an unstillable something is in me; it wants to be heard. A
craving for love is in me, which itself speaks the language of love.

I am light; oh that I were night! But this is my loneliness, that I am
girded by light.

Oh that I were dark and nocturnal! How I would suck at the breasts of
light!

And even you I would bless, you little twinkling stars and glowworms
up there! — And be blissful for your gift of light.

81

Thus S polee Zara thustra



But I live in my own light, I drink back into myself the ﬂames that break
out of me.

I do not the know the happiness of receiving; and often I dreamed that
stealing must be more blessed than receiving.

This is my poverty, that my hand never rests from bestowing; this is
my envy, that I see waiting eyes and the illuminated nights of longing.

Oh misery of all bestowers! Oh darkening of my sun! Oh craving to
crave! Oh ravenous hunger in satiety!

They receive from me, but do I still touch their souls? There is a cleft
between giving and receiving; and the closest cleft is the last to be bridged.

A hunger grows out of my beauty; I wish to harm those for whom I
shine, I wish to rob those on whom I have bestowed: — thus I hunger for
malice.

Withdrawing my hand when a hand already reaches for it; hesitating
like the waterfall that hesitates even while plunging — thus I hunger for
malice.

My fullness plots such vengeance; such trickery gushes from my lone—
liness.

My happiness in bestowing died in bestowing, my virtue wearied of
itself in its superabundance!

For one who always bestows, the danger is loss of shame; whoever
dispenses always has calloused hands and heart from sheer dispensing.

My eye no longer wells up at the shame of those who beg; my hand
became too hard for the trembling of ﬁlled hands.

Where have the tears of my eye and the down of my heart gone? Oh
loneliness of all bestowers! Oh muteness of all who shine!

Many suns revolve in desolate space. To everything that is dark they
speak with their light — to me they are mute.

Oh this is the enmity of light toward that which shines; mercilessly it
goes its orbit.

Unjust in its deepest heart toward that which shines: cold toward
suns — thus every sun goes.

Like a storm the suns ﬂy their orbit, that is their motion. They follow
their inexorable will; that is their coldness.

Oh it is you only, you dark ones, you nocturnal ones, who create warmth
out of that which shines! Oh it is you only who drink milk and refreshment
from the udders of light!

Alas, ice surrounds me, my hand burns itself on iciness! Alas, there is
thirst in me that yearns for your thirst!

speak.

It is night: now all fountains speak more loudly. And my soul too is a
fountain.

It is night: only now all the songs of the lovers awaken. And my soul
too is the song of a lover.

Thus sang Zarathustra.

The Dame Song

One evening Zarathustra walked through the woods with his disciples,
and as he searched for a well, behold, he then came upon a green meadow
that was silently bordered by trees and shrubs; upon it girls danced with
each other. As soon as the girls recognized Zarathustra, they stopped
dancing; but Zarathustra approached them with a friendly gesture and
spoke these words:

“Do not stop dancing, you lovely girls! No spoil sport has come to you
with his evil eye, no enemy of girls.

God's advocate before the devil am I; but the devil is the spirit of gravity.
How couldI be hostile toward godlike dancing, you light ones? Or toward
girls' feet with pretty ankles?

I may well be a wood and a night of dark trees, yet whoever does
not shrink from my darkness will also ﬁnd rose slopes under my
cypresses.

And he will also ﬁnd the little god, surely, who is the favorite of girls;
he lies next to the well, still, with closed eyes.

Indeed, he fell asleep in broad daylight, the loafer! Did he chase too
much after butterﬂies?

Do not be angry with me, you beautiful dancing girls, if I chastise the
little god a bit! He will probably yell and weep — but he is comical even
when weeping!

And with tears in his eyes he shall ask you for a dance, and I myselfwill
sing a song to his dance:

83

Thus S polee Zara thustra



A dance and a mocking song to the spirit of gravity, my supreme highest
and most powerful devil, of whom it is said that he is ‘the ruler of the
world.' ” —

And this is the song that Zarathustra sang as Cupid and the girls danced
together.

Into your eye I gazed recently, oh life! And then into the unfathomable
I seemed to sink.

But you pulled me out with your golden ﬁshing rod; you laughed
mockingly when I called you unfathomable.

“Thus sounds the speech of all ﬁsh,” you said. “What they do not
fathom, is unfathomable.

But I am merely ﬁckle and wild and in all things a woman, and no
Virtuous one:

Whether to you men I am called ‘profundity' or ‘ﬁdelity,' ‘eternity' or
‘secrecy.'

But you men always bestow on us your own virtues — oh, you Virtuous
men!”

Thus she laughed, the incredible one, but I never believe her and her
laughing when she speaks ill of herself.

And when I spoke in conﬁdence with my wild wisdom, she said to me
angrily: “You will, you covet, you love, and only therefore do you praise
life!”

Then I almost answered maliciously and told the angry woman the
truth; and one can not answer more maliciously than when one “tells the
truth” to one's wisdom.

Thus matters stand between the three of us. At bottom I love only
life — and verily, most when I hate it!

But that I am fond of wisdom and often too fond; that is because she
reminds me so much of life!

She has her eyes, her laugh and even her little golden ﬁshing rod — is it
my fault that the two look so much alike?

And when life once asked me: “Who is this wisdom anyway?”— I has—
tened to reply: “Oh yes! Wisdom!

One thirsts for her and does not become sated, one peeks through veils,
one snatches through nets.

Is she beautiful? What do I know! But even the oldest carps are baited
by her.

84

She is ﬁckle and stubborn; often I saw her bite her lip and comb her
hair against the grain.

Perhaps she is evil and false, and in all things a female; but when she
speaks ill of herself, precisely then she seduces the most.”

When I had said this to life she laughed sarcastically and closed her
eyes: “Whom are you talking about?” she said. “Surely about me?

And even if you are right — does one say that to my face? But now speak
too of your own wisdom!”

Oh, and now you opened your eyes again, oh beloved life! And again I
seemed to sink into the unfathomable. —

Thus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance had ended and the girls
departed, he became sad.

“The sun set long ago,” he remarked at last. “The meadow is moist,
coolness emanates from the woods.

Something unknown is around me and it gazes pensively. What — you
are still alive, Zarathustra?

Why? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is it not folly to
continue living? —

Alas, my friends, it is the evening whose questions emerge from me.
Forgive me my sadness!

Evening came: forgive me that evening came!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Grave S orig

“There is the island of graves, the silent one; there too are the graves of
my youth. There I shall carry an evergreen wreath of life.”

Resolving thus in my heart I crossed the sea. —

Oh you visions and apparitions of my youth! Oh all you glances of love,
you godlike glancing moments! How quickly you died! I remember you
today like my dead.

From you, from my dearest departed, comes a sweet fragrance, releasing
my tears and my heart. Indeed, it shakes and releases the heart of this
lonely seafarer.

I am still the richest and the one to be envied most — I the loneliest one!
For I haol you once, and you have me still: tell me, for whom did such rosy
apples fall from the tree as for me?

85

Thus S polee Zara thustra



I am still the heir and earth of your love, blossoming in remembrance
of you with colorful, wild—growing virtues, oh you most beloved!

Indeed, we were made to stay close to each other, you noble, strange
wonders; and not like skittish birds did you come to me and to my
desire — no, as trusting ones to a trusting one!

Yes, made for loyalty, like me, and for tender eternities; I must now refer
to you by your disloyalty, you godlike glances and glancing moments, for
I've learned no other name yet.

Indeed, you died too soon for me, you fugitives. Yet you did not ﬂee
me, nor did I ﬂee you: we are mutually innocent in our disloyalty.

To kill me they strangled you, you songbirds of my hopes! Yes, at you,
my dearest ones, malice always shot its arrows — to strike my heart!

And it struck! For you were always closest to my heart, my posses—
sion and what possessed me: for that you had to die young and all too
early!

The arrow was shot at the most vulnerable thing that I possessed; that
was you, whose skin is like down and even more like a smile that dies of a
glance!

But these words I shall speak to my enemies: what is all murder of
human beings compared to what you did to me!

More evil you did to me than all murder of human beings. You took
from me what was irretrievable — thus I speak to you, my enemies!

For you murdered my youth's visions and dearest wonders! You took
my playmates from me, the blessed spirits! In remembrance of them I lay
down this wreath and this curse.

This curse against you, my enemies! For you cut my eternity short,
like a sound breaks off in cold night! It barely reached me as the ﬂash of
godlike eyes — as a glancing moment!

Thus at a good hour my purity once spoke to me: “Godlike shall all
beings be to me.”

Then you fell upon me with ﬁlthy ghosts; alas, where now has that
good hour ﬂed? “All days shall be holy to me” — so spoke the wisdom of
my youth, once; truly, the speech of a gay wisdom!

But then you enemies stole my nights and sold them into sleepless
agony; alas, where now has my gay wisdom ﬂed?

Once I yearned for happy signs from birds; then you led an owl abom—
ination across my path, a repulsive one. Alas, where then did my tender
yearning ﬂee?

86

Second Part



Once I pledged to renounce all nausea; then you transformed those
near and nearest me into boils of pus. Alas, where then did my noblest
pledge ﬂee?

As a blind man I once walked blessed paths; then you tossed ﬁlth onto
the path of the blind man, and now he is repulsed by the old blind man's
footpath.

And when I did what was hardest for me and celebrated the Victory of
my overcomings; then you made those who loved me cry out that I hurt
them most.

Indeed, that was always your doing; you turned to gall my best honey
and the hard work of my best bees.

You always dispatched the most impudent beggars to my charity;
you always crowded the incurably shameless around my pity. Thus you
wounded my virtue in its faith.

And when I laid down even what was holiest to me as a sacriﬁce;
instantly your “piety” placed its fatter gifts on top, such that what was
holiest to me choked in the smoke of your fat.

And once I wanted to dance as I had never danced before; over and
beyond all heavens I wanted to dance. Then you swayed my favorite
singer.

And then he struck up a horrid, dreadful tune; indeed, he tooted in my
ears like a mournful horn!

Murderous singer, tool of malice, most innocent one! Already I stood
poised for my best dance; then you murdered my enchantment with your
tones!

Only in dance do I know how to speak the parables of the highest
things — and now my highest parable remained unspoken in my limbs!

My highest hope remained unspoken and unredeemed! And all the
visions and comforts of my youth died.

How did I bear it? How did I overturn and overcome such wounds?
How did my soul rise again from these graves?

Yes, there is something invulnerable, unburiable in me, something that
explodes boulders: it is called my will. Silently and unchanged it strides
through the years.

It wants to walk its course on my feet, my old will; its mind is heart—
hardened and invulnerable.

Invulnerable am I only in the heel. You still live and are the same, most
patient one! You have always broken through all graves!

87

Thus S polee Zara thustra



In you what is unredeemed of my youth lives on; and as life and youth
you sit here hoping upon greying ruins of graves.

Yes, to me you are still the shatterer of all graves: Hail to you, my will!
And only where there are graves are there resurrections. —

Thus sang Zarathustra. —

Oh Self—Overeomihg

“Will to truth” you call that which drives you and makes you lustful, you
wisest ones?

Will to thinkability of all being, that's What I call your Will!

You ﬁrst want to malee all being thinkable, because you doubt, with
proper suspicion, whether it is even thinkable.

But for you it shall behave and bend! Thus your will wants it. It shall
become smooth and subservient to the spirit, as its mirror and reﬂection.

That is your entire will, you wisest ones, as a will to power; and even
when you speak of good and evil and of valuations.

You still want to create the world before which you could kneel: this is
your ultimate hope and intoxication.

The unwise, to be sure, the people — they are like a river on which a
skiff ﬂoats; valuations are seated in the skiff, solemn and cloaked.

Your will and your values you set upon the river of becoming; what the
people believe to be good and evil reveals to me an ancient will to power.

It was you, you wisest ones, who placed such guests into the skiff and
gave them pomp and proud names — you and your dominating will!

Now the river carries your skiff along: it has to carry it. It matters little
whether the breaking wave foams and angrily opposes the keel!

The river is not your danger and the end of your good and evil, you wis—
est ones; but this will itself, the will to power — the unexhausted begetting
will of life.

But in order that you understand my words on good and evil, I also
want to tell you my words on life and on the nature of all that lives.

I pursued the living, I walked the greatest and the smallest paths in
order to know its nature.

With a hundredfold mirror I captured even its glance, when its mouth
was closed, so that its eyes could speak to me. And its eyes spoke to me.

However, wherever I found the living, there too I heard the speech on
obedience. All living is an obeying.

88

Second Part



And this is the second thing that I heard: the one who cannot obey
himself is commanded. Such is the nature of the living.

This however is the third thing that I heard: that commanding is harder
than obeying. And not only that the commander bears the burden of all
obeyers, and that this burden easily crushes him: —

In all commanding it seemed to me there is an experiment and a risk;
and always when it commands, the living risks itself in doing so.

Indeed, even when it commands itself, even then it must pay for its
commanding. It must become the judge and avenger and Victim of its own
law.

How does this happen? I asked myself. What persuades the living to
obey and command, and to still practice obedience while commanding?

Hear my words, you wisest ones! Check seriously to see whether I crept
into the very heart of life and into the roots of its heart!

Wherever I found the living, there I found the will to power; and even
in the will of the serving I found the will to be master.

The weaker is persuaded by its own will to serve the stronger, because
it wants to be master over what is still weaker: this is the only pleasure it
is incapable of renouncing.

And as the smaller gives way to the greater, in order for it to have its
pleasure and power over the smallest, so too the greatest gives way, and
for the sake of power it risks — life itself.

That is the giving—way of the greatest, that it is a risk and a danger and
a tossing of dice unto death.

And where there are sacriﬁcing and favors and love—looks, there too is
the will to be master. Along secret passages the weaker sneaks into the
fortress and straight to the heart of the more powerful — and there it steals
power.

And this secret life itself spoke to me: “Behold,” it said, “I am that
which must always overcome itself.

To be sure, you call it will to beget or drive to a purpose, to something
higher, more distant, more manifold: but all this is one, and one secret.

I would rather perish than renounce this one thing; and truly, wher—
ever there is decline and the falling of leaves, behold, there life sacriﬁces
itself — for power!

That I must be struggle and becoming and purpose and the contra—
diction of purposes — alas, whoever guesses my will guesses also on what
erooleea paths it must walk!

89

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Whatever I may create and however I may love it — soon I must oppose
it and my love, thus my will wants it.

And even you, seeker of knowledge, are only a path and footstep of my
will; indeed, my will to power follows also on the heels of your will to
truth!

Indeed, the one who shot at truth with the words ‘will to existence' did
not hit it: this will — does not exist!

For, what is not can not will; but what is in existence, how could this
still will to exist!

Only where life is, is there also will; but not will to life, instead — thus
I teach you — will to power!

Much is esteemed more highly by life than life itself; yet out of esteem—
ing itself speaks — the will to power!” —

Thus life once taught me, and from this I shall yet solve the riddle of
your heart, you wisest ones.

Truly, I say to you: good and evil that would be everlasting — there is
no such thing! They must overcome themselves out of themselves again
and again.

You do violence with your values and words of good and evil, you
valuators; and this is your hidden love and the gleaming, trembling and
ﬂowing—over of your souls.

But a stronger force grows out of your values and a new overcoming;
upon it egg and eggshell break.

And whoever must be a creator in good and evil — truly, he must ﬁrst
be an annihilator and break values.

Thus the highest evil belongs to the highest goodness, but this is the
creative one. —

Let us speak of this, you wisest ones, even if it is bad to do so. Keeping
silent is worse; all truths that are kept silent become poisonous.

And may everything break that can possibly be broken by our truths!
Many a house has yet to be built!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Suhlime Ones

The bottom of my sea is calm — who would guess that it conceals playful
monsters?

My depth is unfathomable, but it gleams with swimming riddles and
laughters.

I saw a sublime one today, a solemn one, an ascetic of the spirit; oh how
my soul laughed at his ugliness!

With his chest sticking out like those who hold their breath he stood
there, the sublime one, silently:

Adorned with ugly truths, his hunter's spoils, and rich in tattered
clothing; many thorns clung to him also — but I saw nary a rose.

He had not yet learned laughing and beauty. Gloomy this hunter
returned from the woods of knowledge.

He returned home from his battle with wild animals; but from his
earnestness too a wild animal gazes — an unconquered one!

And he stands there like a tiger that wants to spring; but I don't like
these tense souls, my taste is hostile to all these retiring types.

And you tell me, friends, that taste and tasting are nothing to be
disputed? But all life is disputing of taste and tasting!

Taste: that is simultaneously weight and scale and weigher, and
woe to all that would live without disputing weight and scale and
weighers!

If he would tire of his sublimity, this sublime one; only then would his
beauty arise — and only then shall I taste him and ﬁnd him tasteful.

And only when he turns away from himself will he leap over his own
shadow — and truly! into his own sun.

All too long he sat in the shadows, and the cheeks of this ascetic of the
spirit grew pale; he nearly starved on his expectations.

There is still contempt in his eyes, and nausea lingers on his lips. He is
peaceful now, to be sure, but his peace has not yet laid itself in the sun.

He should act like a bull; and his happiness should smell of earth and
not of contempt for the earth.

I want to see him as a white bull, snorting and bellowing ahead of the
plow — and his bellowing should praise everything earthly!

He must also unlearn his hero's will; he shall be elevated, not merely
sublime — the ether itself shall elevate him, the will—less one!

He subdued monsters, he solved riddles, but he should also solve
his own monsters and riddles; he should transform them into heavenly
children.

As of yet his knowledge has not learned to smile and to be without
jealousy; his torrential passion has not yet become calm in its beauty.

Indeed, not in satiety shall his yearning keep silent and submerge, but
in beauty! Grace belongs to the graciousness of the great—minded.

With his arm laid across his head — thus the hero should rest, thus too
he should overcome even his resting.

But precisely for the hero heauty is the most difﬁcult of all things.
Beauty is not be wrested by any violent willing.

A little more, a little less: right here this means much, here this means
the most.

To stand with muscles relaxed and with an unharnessed will: this is
most difﬁcult for all of you sublime ones!

When power becomes gracious and descends into view: beauty I call
such descending.

And from no one do I want beauty as I do from just you, you powerful
one: let your kindness be your ultimate self—conquest.

I know you capable of all evil — therefore from you I want the good.

Indeed, I often laughed at the weaklings who believe themselves good
because their paws are lame!

You shall strive to emulate the virtue of a column; ever more beautiful
and delicate it becomes, the higher it rises, but inwardly harder and more
resistant.

Yes, you sublime one, one day you shall be beautiful and shall hold the
mirror up to your own beauty.

Then your soul will shudder with divine desires, and even in your
vanity there will be adoration!

For this is the secret of the soul: only when the hero abandons her, she
is approached in dream by — the over—hero.I

I This allusion to the myth of Ariadne and Theseus foreshadows the “magician‘s song” in Part IV,
which became one of the Diortysus Dithyramhs: Nietzsche was preparing the manuscript of the
Dithyramhs for publication when he became incapacitated after a series of nervous breakdowns
in late 1888 and early 1889: According to the myth, Ariadne is abandoned by her lover Theseus,

Oh the Land ofEtlueatioh

Too far into the future did I ﬂy; dread fell upon me.

And when I looked around, behold! Then time was my only contem—
porary.

Then I ﬂed backward, homeward — with ever greater haste. Thus I
came to you, you of the present, and into the land of education.

For the ﬁrst time I brought along eyes for you, and a strong desire;
indeed, I came with longing in my heart.

But what happened to me? As frightened as I was — I had to laugh!
Never had my eyes seen anything so splattered with colors!

I laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled and my heart as
well: “This must be the home of all paint pots!” I said.

With ﬁfty blotches painted on your face and limbs, thus you sat there
to my amazement, you people of the present!

And with ﬁfty mirrors around you, ﬂattering and echoing your play of
colors!

Indeed, you couldn't wear a better mask, you people of today, than that
of your own face! Who could recognize you!

Written full with the characters of the past, and even these characters
painted over with new characters: thus you have hidden yourselves well
from all interpreters of characters!

And even if one were to give you a physical examination, who would
even believe you have a body? You seem to be baked from colors and paper
slips glued together.

Motley, all ages and peoples peek from your veils; motley, all customs
and beliefs speak from your gestures.

and only Dionysus, the demi—god, comes to her ultimate rescue: Nietzsche elevated Ariadne to
the symbol of the human soul, Theseus to the symbol of male Vanity and all too human (limited)
conceptions of the hero, and Dionysus to the role of super—hero (Uher7Helol): See Adrian Del

If one were to pull away veil and wrap and color and gesture from you,
there would be just enough left over to scare away the crows.

Indeed, I myself am the scared crow who once saw you naked and
without color; and I ﬂew away when the skeleton beckoned amorously.

I would rather be a day laborer in the underworld and among the shades
of yore! — Even the underworldly are fatter and fuller than you!

This, oh this is bitterness for my bowels, that I can stand you neither
naked nor clothed, you people of the present!

All uncanniness of the future, and whatever caused ﬂown birds to
shudder, is truly homelier and more familiar than your “reality.”

For you speak thus: “We are real entirely, and without beliefs and
superstition.” Thus you stick out your chests — alas, even without
chests!

Indeed, how should you be eapahle of believing, you color—splattered
ones — you who are paintings of everything that has ever been
believed!

Rambling refutations of belief itself are you, and the limb—fracturing
of every thought. Uhhelievahle is what I call you, you so—called real
ones!

All ages prattle against each other in your minds; and the dreams and
prattling of all ages were more real than even your waking is!

You are sterile: therefore you lack beliefs. But whoever had to create also
always had his prophetic dreams and astrological signs — and believed in
believing! —

You are half—open gates, at which the gravediggers wait. And this is
your reality: “Everything deserves to perish.”

Oh how you stand there, you sterile ones, how skinny in the ribs! And
some one of you probably realized this on his own.

And he spoke: “Surely some god secretly removed something from me
while I slept? Indeed, enough to form himself a little woman from it!

Wondrous is the poverty of my ribs!” Thus spoke many a person of the
present.

Indeed, you make me laugh, you people of the present! And especially
when you are amazed at yourselves!

And woe to me if I couldn't laugh at your amazement, and had to drink
down all the repugnant contents of your bowls!

So I shall take you more lightly, as I have a heavy burden; and what
does it matter to me if beetles and winged worms still land on my bundle?

Indeed, it will not become any heavier for that! And not from you, you

Alas, where shall I climb now with my longing! From all mountains I

But nowhere did I ﬁnd home; I am unsettled in every settlement, and
a departure at every gate.

Foreign to me and a mockery are these people of the present to whom my
heart recently drove me; and I am driven out of father— and motherlands.

Thus I love only my ehiltlreh's lahol, the undiscovered land in the fur—

I want to make it up to my children for being the child of my fathers;

Oh I mma eula te Perception

When the moon rose yesterday I imagined that it wanted to give birth to
a sun, so broad and pregnant it lay there on the horizon.

But it lied to me with its pregnancy; and sooner would I believe in the
man in the moon than in the woman.

Indeed, he is not much of a man either, this timid nocturnal rhapsodist.
Truly, with a bad conscience he wanders over the rooftops.

For he is lecherous and jealous, this monk in the moon, lecherous for
the earth and for all the joys of lovers.

No, I do not like him, this tomcat on the rooftops! I am disgusted by
all who creep around half—closed windows!

Pious and silent he wanders his way on starry carpets — but I do not
like any soft—stepping man's foot on which a spur does not jingle too.

Every honest step speaks; but a cat steals away across the ground.
Observe, catlike the moon approaches, and dishonestly. —

This parable I give to you sentimental hypocrites, you “pure
perceivers!” I call you — lechers!

You too love the earth and the earthly; I found you out! — But there is
shame in your love and bad conscience — you resemble the moon!

Your spirit was persuaded to despise the earthly, but not your entrails;
and they are the strongest part of you!

And now your spirit is ashamed to do the bidding of your entrails, and
out of its own shame it takes the paths that sneak and lie.

“For me what is highest” — thus speaks your lying spirit to itself —
“would be to look upon life without desire and not like a dog with its
tongue hanging out:

To be content in viewing, with dead will, without the grasp and greed
of selﬁshness — cold and ashen grey in my whole body, but with drunken
mooning eyes!

To me the dearest thing would be” — thus the seducer seduces himself
— “to love the earth as the moon loves it, and to touch its beauty only with
the eyes.

And to me the immaculate perception of all things would be that I
desire nothing from things, except that I might lie there before them like
a mirror with a hundred eyes.” —

Oh you sentimental hypocrites, you lechers! Your desire lacks inno—
cence, and now therefore you slander all desiring!

Indeed, you do not love the earth as creators, begetters, and enjoyers
of becoming!

Where is innocence? Where there is will to beget. And whoever wants
to create over and beyond himself, he has the purest will.

Where is beauty? Where I must will with my entire will; where I want
to love and perish so that an image does not remain merely an image.

Loving and perishing: these have gone together since the beginning of
time. Will to love: that means being willing also for death. Thus I speak
to you cowards!

But now your emasculated leering wants to be called “contemplation!”
And whatever allows itself to be touched by cowardly eyes is supposed to
be christened “beautiful!” Oh you besmirchers of noble names!

But that shall be your curse, you immaculate, you pure—perceiving ones,
that you shall never give birth; and even if you lie broad and pregnant on
the horizon!

Indeed, you take a mouthful of noble words, and we are supposed to
believe that your heart is overﬂowing, you liars?

But my words are meager, despised, crooked words; gladly do I pick up
what falls beneath the table during your meal.

For with them I can still — tell hypocrites the truth! Yes, my ﬁsh bones,
mussel shells and thorny leaves shall tickle the noses of hypocrites!

There is always foul air around you and your meals; after all, your
lecherous thoughts, your lies and secrets are in the air!

Dare for once to believe yourselves — yourselves and your entrails!
Whoever cannot believe himself always lies.

A god's mask you don before yourselves, you “pure ones.” Into a god's
mask your horrid worm has crawled.

Indeed, you deceive, you “contemplative ones!” Zarathustra too was
once the fool of your godlike skins; he had not discovered the coils of
snakes with which they were stuffed.

I once imagined seeing a god's soul playing in your play, you pure
perceivers! Once I imagined no better art than your arts!

The distance concealed snake—ﬁlth and foul odor from me, and that the
guile of a lizard lecherously crawled around here.

But I came hear you: then daylight came to me — and now it comes to
you — the moon's ﬂing is at an end!

Look there! Chagrined and pale he stands there — before the dawn!

For she is coming already, the glowing one — her love for the earth is
coming! Innocence and the creator's desire is all solar love!

Look there, how she glides impatiently across the sea! Do you not feel
her thirst and the hot breath of her love?

She would suck at the sea and drink its depths into herself in the heights;
now the sea's desire rises with a thousand breasts.

It wants to be kissed and sucked by the thirst of the sun; it wants to
become air and height and footpath of light and light itself!

Indeed, like the sun I love life and all deep seas.

And this I call perception: all that is deep shall rise — to my height!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Scholars

As I lay sleeping a sheep munched at the ivy wreath on my head — munched
and spoke: “Zarathustra is no longer a scholar.”

Spoke it and walked away, reproving and proud. A child told it to me.

I like to lie here where the children play, by the crumbling wall, beneath
thistles and red poppies.

I am still a scholar to the children and also to the thistles and the red
poppies. They are innocent, even in their spite.

But to the sheep I am no longer a scholar, thus my fate wants it — blessed
be it!

97

Thus S polee Zara thustra



For this is the truth: I have moved out of the house of the scholars, and
I slammed the door on my way out.

Too long my soul sat hungry at their table; unlike them, I am not trained
to approach knowledge as if cracking nuts.

I love freedom and the air over fresh earth; and I would rather sleep on
OK hides than on their honors and reputations.

I am too hot and burned up by my own thoughts; often it steals my
breath away. Then I have to go out into the open and away from all dusty
chambers.

But they sit cool in their cool shade; in all things they want to be mere
spectators and they take care not to sit where the sun burns on the steps.

Just like those who stand in the street and gape at the people who pass
by; thus too they wait and gape at thoughts that others have thought.

When grasped they puff out clouds of dust like sacks of ﬂour,
involuntarily; but who would guess that their dust comes from grain
and from the yellow bliss of summer ﬁelds?

When they pose as wise, I am chilled by their little proverbs and truths;
often there is an odor to their wisdom, as if it came from the swamp, and
truly, I have already heard the frog croaking out of it!

They are skilled, they have clever ﬁngers; why would my simplicity want
to be near their multiplicity? Their ﬁngers know how to do all manner of
threading and knotting and weaving, and thus they knit the stockings of
the spirit!

They are good clockworks, only one has to see to it that they are properly
wound! Then they indicate the hour faithfully and make only a modest
noise.

Like mills and stamps they work; one need only toss them one's grain
— they know how to grind down kernels and make white dust out of them!

They are good at spying on, and are not the best at trusting one another.
Inventive in petty cleverness they lie in wait for those whose knowledge
walks on lame feet — they lie in wait like spiders.

I have always seen them prepare poison with caution, and always they
donned gloves of glass for their ﬁngers.

And they also know how to play with loaded dice; and I found them so
ardent in their play that they sweated.

We are strangers to one another, and their virtues are even more repug—
nant to me than their falseness and false dice.

And when I dwelled among them, I dwelled over them. For this they
bore a grudge against me.

They will hear nothing of it that someone strolls over their heads; and
so they placed wood and earth and ﬁlth between me and their heads.

Thus they mufﬂed the sound of my steps; and up till now the ones to
hear me least have been the most scholarly.

All that is substandard and weakness in humans they laid between
themselves and me — “sub—ﬂoor” they call it in their houses.

But despite this I stroll with my thoughts over their heads; and even if
I wanted to stroll atop my own mistakes, I would still be over them and
their heads.

For human beings are not equal: thus speaks justice. And what I want,
they would not be permitted to want!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Poets

“Since I have come to know the body better” — Zarathustra said to one of
his disciples — “the spirit is only a hypothetical spirit to me; and all that
is ‘everlasting' — that too is only a parable.”

“Thus I heard you speak once before,” answered the disciple, “and at
that time you added: ‘But the poets lie too much.' Why then did you say
that the poets lie too much?”

“Why?” said Zarathustra. “You ask why? I do not belong to those whose
Why may be questioned.

Is my experience of yesterday? It has been a long time since I experi—
enced the reasons of my opinions.

Would I not have to be a keg of memory if I were also to have my reasons
with me?

It is already too much for me to keep my own opinions, and many a
bird ﬂies away.

And occasionally I ﬁnd in my dovecot an animal that has ﬂown to me,
a strange one that trembles when I lay my hand upon it.

Yet what did Zarathustra once say to you? That the poets lie too
much? — But Zarathustra too is a poet.

Do you believe now that he speaks the truth here? Why do you believe
that?”

99

Thus S polee Zara thustra



The disciple answered: “I believe in Zarathustra.” But Zarathustra
shook his head and smiled.

“Faith does not make me blessed,” he said. “Especially not faith in me.

But supposing that someone said in all earnestness that the poets lie
too much: he is right — we lie too much.

We also know too little and are bad learners, thus we simply have to lie.

And who of us poets has not watered down his wine? Many a poisonous
hodgepodge took place in our cellars, much that is indescribable was
enacted there.

And because we know little, we take a hearty liking to the spiritually
impoverished, especially when they are little young women!

And we are even keen for those things that little old women tell each
other evenings. Within ourselves we call that ‘the eternal feminine.'2

And as if there were a special, secret portal to knowledge that becomes
hloeleeol to those who learn something, thus we believe in the people and
their ‘wisdom.'

But this is what all poets believe: that whoever pricks up his ears while
lying in the grass or on a lonely slope will divine something about the
things that are situated between heaven and earth.

And if tender stirrings come to them, then the poets always think that
nature herself is in love with them:

And she creeps up to their ears to tell them secrets and enamored
ﬂatteries, the like of which makes them boastful and bloated before all
mortals!

Indeed, there are so many things between heaven and earth of which
only the poets have dreamed!

And especially ahove the heavens, for all gods are poets' parable, poets'
cock and bull!

Indeed, always it lifts us up — namely to the kingdom of the clouds;
atop these we set our motley bastards and then call them gods and
overmen —

And they are just light enough for these chairs — all these gods and
overmen!

2 This chapter takes issue with Goethe and elevates him to the status of supreme poet, but it
simultaneously decries the poetic ﬁctions that throughout history sometimes pose as truth: “The
eternal feminine” refers to the conclusion of Faust, where the Chorus Mysticus announces that
Faust is saved, he is lifted up to heaven by the eternal feminine (“Das Ewig—Weibliche/ Zieht uns
hinan”), which here also includes the blessed Margarete (Gretchen): See also Part IV, “The Song
of Melancholy,” where truth and poetizing (ﬁction) are at odds:

Oh how I am weary of all this imperfection that is supposed to become
an event at any cost!”3

When Zarathustra had spoken thus, his disciple was angry with him,
but he remained silent. And Zarathustra too remained silent, and his
gaze had turned inward, as if he were gazing into vast distances. At last
he sighed and took a breath.

“I am of today and of the past,” he said then. “But there is something
in me that is of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and of days to come.

I became weary of the poets, the old and the new; superﬁcial they all
are to me and shallow seas.

They did not think sufﬁciently to the depths, therefore their feeling
did not get to the bottom.

A bit of lust and a bit of boredom — that so far has been their best
contemplation.

Ghost whispers and whisking I consider all their harp jingle jangle;
what have they ever known of the ardor of tones! —

Nor are they clean enough for me; they all muddy their water to make
it seem deep.

And though they gladly pose as reconcilers, to me they remain middle—
men mixers and half—and—halfs and unclean! —

Indeed, I cast my net into their seas and wanted to catch good ﬁsh; but
always I hauled in an ancient god's head.

Thus the sea gave a stone to the hungry. And the poets themselves may
well come from the sea.

To be sure, one ﬁnds pearls in them, and they are all the more similar
to hard shellﬁsh. And instead of a soul I often found salty slime in them.

They also learned vanity from the sea; isn't the sea the peacock of
peacocks?

Even before the ugliest of all buffaloes it fans its tail, it never tires of
its silver and silky fans of lace.

Deﬁantly the buffalo looks on, in his soul close to the sand, still closer
to the thicket, but closest to the swamp.

3 The references to parable, imperfection, and event are all based on the words of the Chorus
Mysticus (see 11. 2), consisting ofonly eight lines, in which Goethe argues that (1) everything not
everlasting is merely a parable; (2) what is imperfect becomes an event here (on earth); (3) what
is indescribable gets done here; and (4) the eternal feminine lifts us up: Zarathustra expresses his
impatience with the glibness of the poets; but observe that he includes the overman among these
airy creations:

101

Thus S polee Zara thustra



What does he care of beauty and sea and peacock's ﬁnery? This parable
I say to the poets.

Truly, their spirit itself is this peacock of peacocks and a sea of vanity!

The spirit of the poet wants spectators: even if they have to be
buffaloes! —

But I became weary of this spirit, and I foresee that it will become weary
of itself.

Transformed I have already seen the poets, and turning their gaze
against themselves.

I saw ascetics of the spirit approaching; they grew out of the poets.”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Great Events

There is an island in the sea — not far from the blessed isles of Zarathustra
— on which a ﬁery mountain smokes continually; the people say of it, and
especially the little old women among the people say of it, that it was
placed like a huge boulder before the gate to the underworld: but through
the ﬁery mountain itself leads the narrow path that winds downward to
this gate of the underworld.

Now it was around the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the blessed
isles that a ship dropped anchor at the island on which the smoking
mountain stands, and its crew went ashore to shoot rabbits. Toward the
hour of noon, however, as the captain and his people were together again,
they suddenly saw a man approaching them through the air, and a voice
clearly said: “It is time! It is high time!” As the ﬁgure came closest to
them — and it ﬂew past quickly like a shadow in the direction of the
ﬁery mountain — they recognized with the greatest dismay that it was
Zarathustra; for all of them had seen him before, except for the captain
himself, and they loved him as the people love, with equal parts of love
and awe.4

4 This story Nietzsche did not make up himself, but as C. G. Jung pointed out in his dissertation of
1902, “On the Psychology and Pathology ofSo—called Occult Phenomena,” Nietzsche inadvertently
remembered it from his childhood reading of Blhtter aus Prevorst, an “antiquated collection of
simple—minded Swabian ghost stories.” The recollection was triggered by Nietzsche‘s thought
process relating to Zarathustra‘s trip to hell: “Cryptoamnesia” or “hidden memory” is to be
distinguished from simple plagiarism because it is caused by the unconscious: See C. G. Jung,
Psychiatric Stuolies in The Collecteol Works ofC. G. juug, vol: 1, ed: Sir Herbert Read, Michael
Fordham, and Gerhard Adler (2nd edn:, Princeton University Press, 1957), pp: Vi, 8273, 10173,

“Just look!” said the old helmsman, “there goes Zarathustra off to
hell!” —

Around the same time that these sailors landed on the ﬁery island
the rumor was circulating that Zarathustra had disappeared; and when
people asked his friends, they related how he had departed by ship at
night, without saying where he would be traveling.

Thus a restlessness arose, but three days later this restlessness was
increased by the sailors' story — and now all the people were saying that
the devil had fetched Zarathustra. His disciples laughed at this news, to be
sure, and one of them even said: “I would sooner believe that Zarathustra
fetched himself the devil.” But at the bottom of their souls all of them
were ﬁlled with worry and longing, and so their joy was great when on
the ﬁfth day Zarathustra appeared among them.

And this is the story of Zarathustra's conversation with the ﬁre hound.5

“The earth,” he said, “has a skin; and this skin has diseases. One of
these diseases for example is called: ‘Human being.'

And another of these diseases is called ‘ﬁre hound'; about him people
have told each other many lies and allowed themselves to be lied to much.

To fathom this mystery I went over the sea, and I saw the naked truth,
indeed, barefoot up to its throat!

Now I know what the ﬁre hound is all about, and likewise all the
underhanded and overthrowing scum—devils of whom not only little old
women are afraid.

‘Out with you, ﬁre hound, out of your depth!' I cried, ‘and confess how
deep is this depth! Where did you get what you are snorting there?

You drink deeply from the sea; your salty eloquence betrays that! Really,
for a hound of the depths you take your nourishment too much from the
surface!

At best I could regard you as the ventriloquist of the earth; and always
when I heard overthrowing and underhanded scum—deVils speaking, I
found them to be the same as you: salty, lying and superﬁcial.

You know how to bellow and to darken with ashes! You are the best big
mouths, and you've learned more than enough about bringing mud to a
boil.

5 The “ﬁre hound” (Feuerhurtol) is Nietzsche‘s invention, an unﬂattering portrait ofa ﬁre—breathing,
revolutionary spirit of the kind who believes in and foments “great events” of a political nature:
The rabble apparently believe in the existence of this ﬁre hound, and are impressed by its hellish
noise:

103

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Wherever you are, there mud always has to be close by, and much that
is spongy, pitted, squeezed, and wants to break free.

“Freedom” the lot of you are best at bellowing, but I lose faith in “great
events” as soon as they are surrounded by much bellowing and smoke.

And just believe me, friend Infernal Racket! The greatest events — these
are not our loudest, but our Stillest hours.

Not around the inventors of new noise does the world revolve, but
around the inventors of new values; ihauolihly it revolves.

And just confess! When your noise and smoke cleared, it was always
very little that had happened. What does it matter that a town becomes a
mummy and a statue lies in the mud!

And these words I say to all overthrowers of statues. Surely it is the
greatest folly to throw salt into the sea and statues into the mud.

In the mud of your contempt lay the statue, but precisely this is its law,
that out of contempt life and living beauty grow back to it!

It stands up again with even more godlike features, seductive in its
suffering, and truly! It will yet thank you for overthrowing it, you
overthrowers!

But this advice I give to kings and churches and to all that is feeble with
age and feeble in virtue — just let yourselves be overthrown! So that you
might come to life again, and to you — virtue!' —

Thus I spoke before the ﬁre hound, then it interrupted me sullenly and
asked: ‘Church? What is that?'

‘Church?' I answered, ‘that is a kind of state, and in fact the most lying
kind. But be silent, you hypocrite hound! You already know your kind
best!

Like you yourself the state is a hypocrite hound; like you it likes to
speak with smoke and bellowing — to make believe, like you, that it speaks
from the belly of things.

For it wants absolutely to be the most important animal on earth, this
state; and people believe it, too.' —

When I ﬁnished saying this the ﬁre hound behaved as though out of
his mind with envy. ‘What?' it shouted, ‘the most important animal on
earth? And they believe it too?' And then so much steam and so many
horrid voices emanated from his throat that I thought he would choke to
death from anger and envy.

At last he grew calmer and his panting let up; but as soon as he was
calm I said laughing:

‘You are angry, ﬁre hound, therefore I am right about you!

And so that I also remain right, hear now about another ﬁre hound:
one who really speaks from the heart of the earth.

His breath exhales gold and golden rain — thus his heart wants it. What
are ash and smoke and hot slime to him!

Laughter ﬂutters out of him like a colorful cloud; he is ill disposed
toward your gurgling and spitting and the growling of your bowels!

But gold and laughter — that he takes from the heart of the earth; for
you should know — the heart of the earth is made of gold.'

When the ﬁre hound heard this he could no longer stand to listen to
me. Ashamed, he tucked in his tail and barked a feeble ‘bow—wow,' then
he crawled down into his cave.” —

Thus recounted Zarathustra. But his disciples scarcely listened to him,
so great was their desire to tell him about the sailors, the rabbits and the
ﬂying man.

“What am I supposed to think of that?” he said. “Am I some kind of
ghost?

But it must have been my shadow. You must have heard something
before about a wanderer and his shadow?6

What is certain, however, is that I must keep him shorter — otherwise
he will ruin my reputation.”

And once again Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. “What am
I supposed to think of that?” he said once more.

“Why did the ghost shout: ‘It is time! It is high time!'

For what then is it — high time?” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Soothsayer

“— and I saw a great sadness descend over humanity. The best became
weary of their works.

A doctrine circulated, a belief accompanied it: ‘Everything is empty,
everything is the same, everything was!'

And from every hilltop it rang out: ‘Everything is empty, everything is
the same, everything was!'

Thus S polee Zara thustra



We harvested well, but why did all our fruits turn foul and brown?
What fell down from the evil moon last night?

All work was for naught, our wine has become poison, the evil eye
seared yellow our ﬁelds and hearts.

All of us became dry, and if ﬁre were to touch us, then we would turn
to dust like ashes — yes, ﬁre itself we have made weary.

All our wells dried up, even the sea retreated. All ﬁrm ground wants to
crack, but the depths do not want to devour!

‘Oh where is there still a sea in which one could drown?' — thus rings
our lament — out across the shallow swamps.

Indeed, we have already become too weary to die; now we continue to
wake and we live on — in burial chambers!” —

Thus Zarathustra heard a soothsayer speaking; and his prophecy went
straight to his heart and transformed him. Sadly he went about and weary;
and he became like those of whom the soothsayer had spoken.

“Indeed,” thus he spoke to his disciples, “it lacks but little and this long
twilight will come. Alas, how shall I rescue my light to the other side!

It must not suffocate in this sadness! It shall be light to more distant
worlds and most distant nights!”

Grieving thus in his heart Zarathustra walked about; and for three days
he took no drink and no food, had no rest and lost his speech. At last it
came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep. But his disciplines sat around
him on long night watches and they waited anxiously for him to wake and
speak again, and recover from his melancholy.

This, however, is the speech that Zarathustra spoke when he awoke;
but his voice came to his disciples as if from far away.

“Hear this dream that I dreamed, my friends, and help me to understand
its meaning!

It is still an enigma to me, this dream; its meaning is hidden in it and
locked away and it does not yet ﬂy above it on free wings.

I had renounced all life, thus I dreamed. I had become a night watch—
man and guardian of graves, there on the lonely mountain fortress of
death.

Up there I guarded his cofﬁns; the musty vaults stood full of such
symbols of conquest. From glass cofﬁns, conquered life looked out at me.

I breathed the odor of eternities turned to dust; my soul lay clammy
and dusty, and who could have aired his soul in such a place!

106

Second Part



The brightness of midnight was about me always, loneliness crouched
beside her, and thirdly, death—rattle silence, the worst of my three lady
friends.

I carried keys, the rustiest of all keys; and with them I knew how to
open the creakiest of all gates.

Like a bitterly evil croaking the sound penetrated through the long
corridors as the gate's wings swung open; hideously this bird screeched,
deﬁant in being awakened.

But even more terrible and heart—constricting was the silence that set
in around me when the gate fell quiet, and I sat alone in this treacherous
silence.

Thus the time passed and crept by me, if time existed anymore — what
do I know! But at last something happened that awakened me.

Three times there were blows at the door, like thundering, and the
vaults echoed and howled three times in return; then I went to the gate.

‘Alpa!' I cried. ‘Who bears his ashes to the mountain? Alpa! Alpa! Who
bears his ashes to the mountain?'7

And I pressed the key and lifted on the gate and strained. But it would
not open even the width of a ﬁnger:

Then a roaring wind tore its wings apart; whistling, shrilling and whip—
ping it threw down a black cofﬁn before me:

And amidst the roaring and whistling and shrilling the cofﬁn burst
open and spewed forth thousandfold laughter.

And it laughed and mocked and roared against me from a thousand
grimaces of children, angels, owls, fools and butterﬂies the size of children.

I was horribly frightened; it threw me to the ground. And I cried out
in terror as I have never cried before.

But my own cries awakened me — and I came to. 7”

Thus Zarathustra related his dream and then he was silent, for he did
not yet know the interpretation of his dream. But the disciple whom he
loved most quickly stood up, took hold of Zarathustra's hand and said:

7 Nietzsche is here using material from a dream he had: He explained the dream to his friend Reinhart
von Seydlitz in 1877, and mention of “Alpa” shows up in the unpublished notes of summer 1877:
See Kritische Stuoliertausgahe XIV: 306: In his dream, Nietzsche was nearing the top of a seemingly
endless mountain path when he passed a cave, out of which a mysterious voice cried: “Alpa,
Alpa 7 who carries his ashes to the mountains?” German Alptraum, or nightmare, is based
on oler Alp, which according to superstition is a ghost that crouches on the chest of the dreamer
and causes bad dreams by pressuring or suffocating:

107

Thus S polee Zara thustra



“Your life itself interprets this dream for us, oh Zarathustra!

Are you yourself not the wind with its shrill whistling, that tears open
the gates of the fortresses of death?

Are you yourself not the cofﬁn full of colorful sarcasms and the angelic
grimaces of life?

Indeed, like thousandfold children's laughter Zarathustra comes into all
burial chambers, laughing at these night watchmen and grave guardians,
and whoever else rattles about with dingy keys.

You will frighten and lay them low with your laughter; your power over
them will be proven by their swooning and awakening.

And even if the long twilight comes and the weariness unto death, you
will not set in our sky, you advocate of life!

You allowed us to see new stars and new splendors of the night; indeed,
you spanned laughter itself above us like a colorful tent.

Children's laughter will well up from cofﬁns from now on; a strong
wind will come triumphantly to all weariness unto death from now on: of
this you yourself are our guarantor and soothsayer!

Indeed, you yourself dreamed them, your enemies: that was your hardest
dream!

But as you awakened from them and came to yourself, thus shall they
awaken from themselves — and come to you!” —

Thus spoke the disciple, and all the others now crowded around
Zarathustra and took him by the hands and wanted to persuade him to
abandon his bed and his sadness and to return to them. But Zarathustra
sat upright on his bed and with a strange look. Like someone who returns
home from long sojourns abroad, he gazed at his disciples and examined
their faces; and still he did not recognize them. But as they lifted him and
helped him to his feet, behold, all at once his eyes transformed; he compre—
hended all that had happened, stroked his beard and said in a strong voice:

“Well then! This has its time; but for now see to it, my disciples, that
we prepare a good meal, and quickly! Thus I plan to do penance for bad
dreams!

But the soothsayer shall eat and drink beside me; and truly, I will yet
show him a sea in which he can drown!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra. Then, however, he gazed long into the face
of the disciple who had served as the dream interpreter, and he shook his

head. —

Oh Redemption

As Zarathustra crossed over the great bridge one day, the cripples and the
beggars surrounded him and a hunchback spoke thus to him:

“Behold, Zarathustra! The people too learn from you and are gaining
faith in your teaching; but in order to believe you completely, they need
one more thing — you must ﬁrst persuade us cripples! Here you have a ﬁne
selection and truly, an opportunity with more than one scruff! You can
heal the blind and make the lame walk; and for the one who has too much
behind him, you could surely take a bit away — that, I believe, would be
the right way to make the cripples believe in Zarathustra!”

Zarathustra, however, responded to the speaker thus: “If one takes the
hump from the hunchback, then one takes his spirit too — thus teach the
people. And if one gives the blind man his eyesight, then he sees too many
bad things on earth, such that he curses the one who healed him. But the
one who makes the lame walk causes him the greatest harm, for scarcely
does he begin to walk when his vices run away with him — thus teach the
people about cripples. And why should Zarathustra not learn also from
the people, if the people learn from Zarathustra?

But it is the least thing to me, since I have been among human beings,
when I see ‘This one is missing an eye and That one an ear and the Third
one a leg, and there are Others who lost their tongue or their nose or their
head.'

I see and have seen worse, and some of it so hideous that I do not want
to speak of everything, and of a few things I do not even want to remain
silent; namely human beings who were missing everything except the one
thing they have too much of — human beings who are nothing more than
one big eye, or one big maw or one big belly or some other big thing —
inverse cripples I call such types.

And as I came out of my solitude and crossed over this bridge the ﬁrst
time, then I didn't believe my eyes and I looked and I looked again and
said at last: ‘That is an ear! An ear as big as a person!' And I looked
more closely, and really, beneath the ear something was moving that was
pitifully small and pathetic and thin. And, in truth, the gigantic ear sat
upon a little slender stalk — but the stalk was a human being! If one used a
magnifying glass one could even recognize a tiny, envious miniature face;
even a bloated little soul dangling on the stalk. But the people told me
that the big ear was not only a human being, but a great human being,

109

Thus S polee Zara thustra



a genius. But I have never believed the people when they speak of great
human beings — and I maintained my belief that it was an inverse cripple
who had too little of everything and too much of one thing.”

When Zarathustra had spoken thus to the hunchback and to those for
whom he had served as mouthpiece and advocate, he turned deeply upset
to his disciples and said:

“Truly, my friends, I walk among human beings as among the fragments
and limbs of human beings!

This is what is most frightening to my eyes, that I ﬁnd mankind in
ruins and scattered about as if on a battle ﬁeld or a butcher ﬁeld.

And if my gaze ﬂees from the now to the past; it always ﬁnds the same:
fragments and limbs and grisly accidents — but no human beings!

The now and the past on earth — alas, my friends — that is what is most
unbearable to me. And I would not know how to live if I were not also a
seer of that which must come.

A seer, a willer, a creator, a future himself and a bridge to the future —
and alas, at the same time a cripple at this bridge: all that is Zarathustra.

And you too asked yourselves often: ‘Who is Zarathustra to us? How
shall he be known to us?' And like me you gave yourselves questions for
answers.

Is he a promiser? Or a fulﬁller? A conqueror? Or an inheritor? An
autumn? Or a plow? A physician? Or a convalescent?

Is he a poet? Or a truthful man? A liberator? Or a tamer? A good man?
Or an evil man?

I walk among human beings as among the fragments of the future; that
future that I see.

And all my creating and striving amounts to this, that I create and
piece together into one, what is now fragment and riddle and grisly
accident.

And how could I bear to be a human being if mankind were not also
creator and solver of riddles and redeemer of accident?

To redeem those who are the past and to recreate all ‘it was' into ‘thus
I willed it!' — only that would I call redemption!

Will — thus the liberator and joy bringer is called; thus I taught you, my
friends! And now learn this in addition: the will itself is still a prisoner.

Willing liberates, but what is that called, which claps even the liberator
in chains?

110

Second Part



‘It was': thus is called the Will's gnashing of teeth and loneliest
misery. Impotent against that which has been — it is an angry specta—
tor of everything past.

The will cannot will backward; that it cannot break time and time's
greed — that is the Will's loneliest misery.

Willing liberates; what does willing plan in order to rid itself of its
misery and mock its dungeon?

Alas, every prisoner becomes a fool! Foolishly as well the imprisoned
will redeems itself.

That time does not run backward, that is its wrath. ‘That which
was' — thus the stone is called, which it cannot roll aside.

And so it rolls stones around out of wrath and annoyance, and
wreaks revenge on that which does not feel wrath and annoyance as it
does.

Thus the will, the liberator, became a doer of harm; and on every—
thing that is capable of suffering it avenges itself for not being able to go
back.

This, yes this alone is revenge itself: the Will's unwillingness toward
time and time's ‘it was.'

Indeed, a great folly lives in our will; and it became the curse of all
humankind that this folly acquired spirit!

The spirit of revenge: my friends, that so far has been what mankind
contemplate best; and wherever there was suffering, punishment was
always supposed to be there as well.

For ‘punishment' is what revenge calls itself; with a lying word it hypo—
critically asserts its good conscience.

And because in willing itself there is suffering, based on its inability to
will backward — thus all willing itself and all living is supposed to be —
punishment!

And now cloud upon cloud rolled in over the spirit, until at last madness
preached: ‘Everything passes away, therefore everything deserves to pass
away!

And this itself is justice, this law of time that it must devour its own
children' — thus preached madness.

‘All things are ordained ethically according to justice and punishment.
Alas, where is redemption from the ﬂux of things and from the punishment
called existence?' Thus preached madness.

111

Thus S polee Zara thustra



‘Can there be redemption, if there is eternal justice? Alas, the stone “it
was” is unmoveable; all punishments too must be eternal!' Thus preached
madness.

‘No deed can be annihilated; how could it be undone through
punishment? This, this is what is eternal about the punishment called
existence, that existence must also eternally be deed and guilt again!

Unless the will were to ﬁnally redeem itself and willing became not—
willing — '; but my brothers, you know this fable song of madness!

Away from these fable songs I steered you when I taught you: ‘The will
is a creator.'

All ‘it was' is a fragment, a riddle, a grisly accident — until the creating
Will says to it: ‘But I Will it thus! I shall Will it thus!'

But has it ever spoken thus? And when will this happen? Is the will
already unharnessed from its own folly?

Has the will already become its own redeemer and joy bringer? Has it
unlearned the spirit of revenge and all gnashing of teeth?

And who taught it reconciliation with time, and what is higher than
any reconciliation?

That will which is the will to power must will something higher than
any reconciliation —

but how shall this happen? Who would teach it to also will backward?”

— But at this point in his speech Zarathustra suddenly broke off and
looked entirely like one who is appalled in the extreme. Appalled he
looked at his disciples, his eyes penetrated their thoughts and their secret
thoughts as if with arrows. But after a little while he laughed again and
said, more calmly:

“It's difﬁcult to live with people because keeping silent is so hard.
Especially for someone who is talkative.” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra. The hunchback meanwhile had listened to
the conversation with his face covered, but when he heard Zarathustra
laugh he looked up inquisitively and slowly said:

“But why does Zarathustra speak otherwise to us than to his disciples?”

Zarathustra answered: “What's to wonder about in that! One is allowed
to speak hunched with hunchbacks!”

“Good,” said the hunchback, “and with pupils one may tell tales out
of school.

But why does Zarathustra speak otherwise to his pupils — than to
himself?” —

Oh Human Prudence

Not the height: the precipice is what is terrible!

The precipice, where one's gaze plunges tlowhwarol and one's hand
grasps upwarol. There the heart is dizzy from its double will.

Oh my friends, can you guess even my heart's double will?

This, this is my precipice and my danger, that my gaze plunges into the
heights and that my hand must hold to and support itself— on the depths!

My will clings to mankind, I bind myself with chains to mankind
because I am drawn upward to the overman; for there my other will wills
me.

And for this I live blind among people, just as if I did not know them:
so that my hand does not entirely lose its faith in the ﬁrm.

I do not know you human beings; this darkness and solace are often
spread around me.

I sit at the gateway for every rogue and ask: who wants to deceive me?

That is my ﬁrst human prudence, that I allow myself to be deceived,
in order to not be on the lookout for deceivers.

Indeed, if I were on the lookout for mankind, how could mankind be
an anchor to my ball? Too easily I would be swept up and away!

This providence lies over my destiny, that I cannot be provident.

And whoever would not die of thirst among human beings must learn
to drink from all glasses; and whoever would remain clean among human
beings must understand how to wash himself even with dirty water.

And thus I often spoke to comfort myself: “Well then! Cheer up, old
heart! One misfortune failed you; enjoy this as your — fortune!”

But this is my other human prudence: I spare the vain more than the
proud.

Is wounded vanity not the mother of all tragedies? But where pride is
wounded, there something even better than pride grows.

For life to be a proper spectacle, its play must be well—played; but for
this good play actors are needed.

I found all vain people to be good actors; they play and want to be
spectacular — all their spirit is focused in this willing.

They perform themselves, they invent themselves; in their proximity
I love to be a spectator of life — it heals me of my melancholy.

Therefore I spare the vain, because they are physicians for my melan—
choly and keep me riveted to people as if to a play.

113

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And then: who could measure the full depth of the vain man's modesty!
I mean him well and pity him his modesty.

From you he wants to acquire his faith in himself; he nourishes himself
from your glances, he eats praise from your hands.

He even believes your lies, when you lie well about him; for at bottom
his heart sighs: “what am I?”

And if the truest virtue is the one that is not aware of itself, well; the
vain man knows nothing of his modesty! —

But this is my third human prudence, that I do not allow my view of
the evil ones to be spoiled by your fearfulness.

I am enchanted to see the wonders hatched by a hot sun: tigers and
palm trees and rattle snakes.

Even among human beings there is a beautiful brood of the hot sun
and much that is wonderworthy in those who are evil.

To be sure, just as your wisest did not strike me as quite so wise, so too
I found the malice of human beings unequal to its reputation.

And often I shook my head and asked: Why do you keep rattling, you
rattle snakes?

Indeed, even for evil there is still a future! And the hottest south has
not yet been discovered for mankind.

How much is regarded today as the most egregious malice when in fact
it is only twelve shoes wide and three months long! But some day bigger
dragons will come into the world.

For in order for the overman to not lack his dragon, the over—
dragon that is worthy of him, much hot sun must yet glow on humid
jungle!

Your wild cats must ﬁrst have turned to tigers and your poisonous toads
to crocodiles; for the good hunter shall have a good hunt!

And truly, you good and just! In you there is much to laugh at and
especially your fear of what up till now has been called “devil!”

So estranged from greatness are you in your souls that the overman
would seem terrihle to you in his kindness!

And you wise and knowing ones, you would ﬂee from the sunburn of
wisdom in which the overman joyfully bathes his nakedness!

You highest human beings whom I have ever laid eyes on — this is my
doubt in you and my secret laughter: I suspect you would call my overman
— devil!

114

Second Part



Oh, I became weary of these highest and best; from their “height” I
longed upward, outward, and away to the overman!

A dread overcame me when I saw these best human beings naked: then
I sprouted wings to soar away into distant futures.

Into more distant futures, into more southern souths than ever a painter
dreamed; there, where gods are ashamed of all clothing!

But I want to see you costumed, you neighbors and fellow human
beings, and well groomed, and vain, and digniﬁed, as “the good and the
just” —

And costumed I myself want to sit among you — so that I might not
recognize you and myself; for that is my ﬁnal human prudence.

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Stillest Hour

What happened to me, my friends? You see me distraught, chased away,
reluctantly obedient, prepared to go — alas, to go away from you!

Yes, once again Zarathustra must return to his solitude; but this time
the bear returns to his cave unwillingly!

What happened to me? Who commanded this? — Alas, my angry mis—
tress wills it so, she spoke to me — did I ever mention her name to you?

Yesterday toward evening my stillest hour spoke to me: that is the name
of my terrible mistress.

And this is how it happened — for I must tell you everything, so your
hearts do not harden against the one who must depart abruptly!

Do you know the terror of the one who is falling asleep? —

He is stricken with terror down to his toes because the ground is fading
and the dream begins.

This I say to you as a parable. Yesterday, at the stillest hour, the ground
faded from me, the dream began.

The hand advanced, the clock of my life drew a breath — never had I
heard such stillness around me, so that my heart was terriﬁed.

Then without voice it spoke to me: “ You lehow it, Zarathustra?” —

And I cried out in terror on hearing this whispering, and the blood
drained from my face, but I kept silent.

Then it spoke to me once more without voice: “You know it Zarathustra,
but you do not speak it!” —

115

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And at last I answered deﬁantly: “Indeed, I know it, but I do not want
to speak it!”

Then it spoke to me again without voice: “You do not want to,
Zarathustra? Is this even true? Do not hide in your deﬁance!” —

And I wept and trembled like a child and spoke: “Oh, I wanted to, yes,
but how can I? Spare me this one thing! It is beyond my strength!”

Then it spoke to me again without voice: “What do you matter,
Zarathustra? Speak your word and break!” —

And I answered: “Alas, is it my word? Who am I? I am waiting for one
more worthy; I am not worthy even of breaking under it.”

Then it spoke to me again without voice: “What do you matter?
You are not yet humble enough for me. Humility has the toughest
hide.” —

And I answered: “What has the hide of my humility not borne already!
I dwell at the foot of my height; how high are my peaks? No one yet has
told me. But well do I know my valleys.”

Then it spoke to me again without voice: “Oh Zarathustra, whoever
has mountains to move must also move valleys and hollows.” —

And I answered: “As of yet my words have moved no mountains, and
what I spoke did not reach mankind. I went to human beings, to be sure,
but I have not yet arrived among them.”

Then it spoke to me again without voice: “What do you know of that!
The dew lands on the grass when the night is most silent.” —

And I answered: “They mocked me when I found and walked my own
way; and in truth my feet trembled at that time.

And thus they spoke to me: ‘You have forgotten the way, and now you
are forgetting how to walk too!'”

Then it spoke to me again without voice: “What does their mock—
ery matter! You are one who has forgotten how to obey; now you shall
command!

Do you not know who is needed most by everyone? The one who
commands great things.

To accomplish great things is difﬁcult; but what is even more difﬁcult
is to command great things.

That is what is most unforgivable in you: you have the power, and you
do not want to rule.” —

And I answered: “I lack the lion's voice for all commanding.”

116

Second Part



Then it spoke to me again like a whispering: “The stillest words are
those that bring the storm. Thoughts that come on the feet of doves steer
the world.

Oh Zarathustra, you shall go as a shadow of that which must come;
thus you will command and lead the way commanding.” —

And I answered: “I am ashamed.”

Then it spoke to me again without voice: “You must become a child
again and without shame.

The pride of youth is still on you, you became young at a late time; but
whoever would become a child must also overcome his youth.” —

And I thought for a long time and trembled. At last however I said what
I had said at ﬁrst: “I do not want to.”

Then laughter broke out around me. Alas, how this laughter tore my
entrails and slit open my heart!

And it spoke to me one last time: “Oh Zarathustra, your fruits are ripe
but you are not ripe for your fruits!

Thus you must return to your solitude, for you shall yet become
mellow.” —

And again there was laughing and it vanished; then it became still
around me as if with twofold stillness. But I lay on the ground and the
sweat poured from my limbs.

— Now you have heard everything, and why I must return to my solitude.
I withheld nothing from you, my friends.

But hear this from me as well, I who am still the most tightlipped of
human beings — and want to be so!

Oh my friends! There is still something I could tell you, there is still
something I could give you! Why do I not give it? Am I stingy? —

But when Zarathustra had spoken these words he was overcome by the
force of his pain and the nearness of parting from his friends, so that he
wept out loud; and no one was able to comfort him. At night, however,
he went away alone and left his friends.

You look upward when you long for elevation. And I look down

The Wanderer

It was around midnight that Zarathustra started his route over the ridge
of the island, in order to arrive at the other coast by early morning;
for there he intended to board a ship. At that location there was safe
harborage where even foreign ships liked to anchor; these would take
the occasional passenger who wanted to cross the sea from the blessed
isles. Now as Zarathustra climbed up the mountain he thought as he
traveled about his many lonely wanderings since the time of his youth,
and about how many mountains and ridges and peaks he had already
climbed.

I am a wanderer and a mountain climber, he said to his heart. I do not
like the plains and it seems I cannot sit still for long.

And whatever may come to me now as destiny and experience — it will
involve wandering and mountain climbing: ultimately one experiences
only oneself.

The time has passed in which accidents could still befall me, and what
eoulol fall to me now that is not already my own?

It merely returns, it ﬁnally comes home to me — my own self and
everything in it that has long been abroad and scattered among all things
and accidents.

And I know one more thing: I am standing now before my last peak and
before what has been saved for me for the longest time. Indeed, I must
start my hardest path! Indeed, I have begun my loneliest hike!

But whoever is of my kind does not escape such an hour, the hour that
speaks to him: “Only now do you go your way of greatness! Peak and
abyss — they are now merged as one!

You go your way of greatness; now what was formerly your ultimate
danger has become your ultimate refuge!

You go your way of greatness; now it must be your best courage that
there is no longer a way behind you!

You go your way of greatness; here no one shall sneak along after you!
Your foot itself erased the path behind you, and above it stands written:
impossibility.

And if now all ladders should fail, then you must know how to climb
on your own head — how else would you climb upward?

On your own head and over and beyond your own heart! Now what is
mildest in you must become hardest.

121

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Whoever has always spared himself much gets sick in the end from so
much coddling. Praised be whatever makes hard! I do not praise the land
where butter and honey ﬂow!

It is necessary to loole away from oneself in order to see much: this
hardness is needed by every mountain climber.

But whoever is importunate with his eyes as a seeker of knowledge —
how could he see more of things than their foregrounds?

But you, Zarathustra, you wanted to see the ground and background
of all things, and so you must climb over yourself— up, upward, until you
have even your stars heueath you!”

Yes, look down on myself and even on my stars: only that would I call
my peale, that remains to me as my ultimate peak! —

Thus Zarathustra spoke to himself as he climbed, comforting his heart
with hard sayings, for he was sore in his heart as never before. And as
he came to the top of the mountain ridge, behold, there lay the other sea
stretching before him, and he stood still and silent for a long time. But at
this altitude the night was cold and clear and bright with stars.

I recognize my lot, he said at last, with sorrow. Well then! I am ready.
Just now my ultimate solitude began.

Oh this black sad sea beneath me! Oh this pregnant nocturnal
moroseness! Oh destiny and sea — now I must aeseeuol to you!

I stand before my highest mountains and before my longest hike: there—
fore I must descend deeper than I ever climbed before:

— descend deeper into suffering than I ever climbed before, down into
its blackest ﬂood! My destiny wills it so: Well then! I am ready.

Where did the highest mountains come from? Thus I once asked. Then
I learned that they come from the sea.

This testimony is written into their stone and onto the walls of their
peaks. From the deepest the highest must come into its height. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra at the pinnacle of the mountain, where it was
cold. But as he came near to the sea and stood at last alone among the cliffs,
then he had grown weary from his travels and felt even greater longing
than before.

Everything is still sleeping, he said; even the sea sleeps. Drunk with
sleep and strangely it looks at me.

But it breathes warmly, that I feel. And I also feel that it is dreaming.
Dreaming it tosses on hard pillows.

Listen! Listen! How it moans with evil memories — or evil forebodings?

Yes, I am sad along with you, you dark monster, and for your sake
annoyed even with myself.

Oh that my hand does not possess sufﬁcient strength! Gladly indeed
would I redeem you from evil dreams! —

And as Zarathustra spoke thus he laughed at himself with melancholy
and bitterness. “What, Zarathustra!” he said. “Do you want to sing com—
fort even to the sea?

Oh you loving fool Zarathustra, you who are over—blessed with trust!
But you have always been so; always you came trustingly to all that is
terrible.

You wanted to caress every monster. A hint of warm breath, a bit of
soft shag on the paw — and already you were prepared to love it and lure
It.

Love is the danger of the loneliest one, love of everything if only it lives!
Laughable indeed are my folly and my modesty in love!” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra and he laughed once again. But then he
remembered the friends he left behind — and as if he had violated them
with his thoughts, he became angry for his thoughts. And suddenly the
laughing one began to weep — for wrath and longing Zarathustra wept
bitterly.

Oh the Vision and the Riddle
1

When it was rumored among the sailors that Zarathustra was on the ship —
for a man who came from the blessed isles went on board at the same time
as him — then a great curiosity and anticipation arose. But Zarathustra
kept silent for two days and was cold and deafwith sadness, such that he
answered neither to glances nor questions. On the evening of the second
day, however, he opened his ears again, even though he continued to be
silent; for there was much that was peculiar and dangerous to be heard
on this ship, which had come from far away and wanted to go still farther.
But Zarathustra was a friend of all who make distant journeys and do not
like to live without danger, and so, ﬁnally, his own tongue was freed while
listening, and the ice of his heart broke: then he began to speak thus:

To you, bold searchers, researchers,I and whoever put to terrible seas
with cunning sails —

to you, the riddle—drunk, the twilight—happy whose souls are lured by
ﬂutes to every maelstrom:

— because you do not want to probe along a thread with cowardly hands;
and because where you can guess, there you hate to deduce —

to you alone I tell the riddle that I saw — the vision of the loneliest one. —

Darkly I walked recently through cadaver—colored twilight — darkly and
hard, biting my lip. Not only one sun had set for me.

A path that climbed deﬁantly through boulders, a malicious, lonely
path consoled neither by weed nor shrub — a mountain path crunched
under the deﬁance of my foot.

Striding mutely over the mocking clatter of pebbles, crushing the rock
that caused it to slip; thus my foot forced its way upward.

Upward — in deﬁance of the spirit that pulled it downward, the spirit
of gravity, my devil and arch—enemy.

Upward — even though he sat atop me, half dwarf, half mole, lame,
paralyzing, dripping lead into my ear, lead—drop thoughts into my
brain.

“Oh Zarathustra,” he murmured scornfully, syllable by syllable. “You
stone of wisdom! You hurled yourselfhigh, but every hurled stone must —
fall!

Oh Zarathustra, you stone of wisdom, you sling stone, you star crusher!
You hurled yourself so high — but every hurled stone — must fall!

Sentenced to yourself and to your own stoning; oh Zarathustra, far
indeed you hurled the stone — but it will fall back down upon you!”

Then the dwarf became silent, and that lasted a long time. But his
silence oppressed me, and being at two in such a way truly makes one
lonelier than being at one!

I climbed, I climbed, I dreamed, I thought — but everything
oppressed me. I resembled a sick person whose severe agonies make him

weary, and who is then jarred out of falling asleep by an even worse
dream. —

But there is something in me that I call courage: this so far has slain
my every discourage. This courage at last commanded me to stand still
and to say: “Dwarf— you or I!” —

Courage after all is the best slayer — courage that attaeles; for in every
attack there is sounding brass.

But the human being is the most courageous animal, and so it overcame
every animal. With sounding brass it even overcame every pain, but human
pain is the deepest pain.

Courage also slays dizziness at the abyss; and where do human beings
not stand at the abyss? Is seeing itself not — seeing the abyss?

Courage is the best slayer; courage slays even pity. But pity is the
deepest abyss, and as deeply as human beings look into life, so deeply too
they look into suffering.

But courage is the best slayer, courage that attacks; it slays even death,
for it says: “Was that life? Well then! One More Time!”

In such a saying, however, there is much sounding brass. He who has
ears to hear, let him hear!

“Stop, dwarf!” I said. “I — or you! But I am the stronger of us two — you
do not know my abysmal thought! That — you could not bear!” —

Then something happened that made me lighter, for the dwarfjumped
down from my shoulder, the inquisitive one, and he crouched upon a
stone there before me. But right there where we stopped was a gateway.

“See this gateway, dwarf!” I continued. “It has two faces. Two paths
come together here; no one has yet walked them to the end.

This long lane back: it lasts an eternity. And that long lane outward —
that is another eternity.

They contradict each other, these paths; they blatantly offend each
other — and here at this gateway is where they come together. The name
of the gateway is inscribed at the top: ‘Moment.'

But whoever were to walk one of them further — and ever further and
ever on: do you believe, dwarf, that these paths contradict each other
eternally?” —

“All that is straight lies,” murmured the dwarf contemptuously. “All
truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.”

125

Thus S polee Zara thustra



“You spirit of gravity!” I said, angrily. “Do not make it too easy on
yourselﬂ Or I shall leave you crouching here where you crouch, lamefoot —
and I bore you this high!

See this moment!” I continued. “From this gateway Moment a long
eternal lane stretches haelewarol: behind us lies an eternity.

Must not whatever can already have passed this way before? Must
not whatever can happen, already have happened, been done, passed by
before?

And if everything has already been here before, what do you think of
this moment, dwarf? Must this gateway too not already — have been here?

And are not all things ﬁrmly knotted together in such a way that this
moment draws after it all things to come? Therefore — itself as well?

For, whatever can run, even in this long lane outwarol — must run it once
more! —

And this slow spider that creeps in the moonlight, and this moonlight
itself, and I and you in the gateway whispering together, whispering of
eternal things — must not all of us have been here before?

— And return and run in that other lane, outward, before us, in this
long, eerie lane — must we not return eternally? 7”

Thus I spoke, softer and softer, for I was afraid of my own thought and
secret thoughts. Then, suddenly, I heard a dog howl nearby.

Had I ever heard a dog howl like this? My thoughts raced back. Yes!
When I was a child, in my most distant childhood:

— then I heard a dog howl like this. And I saw it too, bristling, its head
up, trembling in the stillest midnight when even dogs believe in ghosts:

— so that I felt pity. For the full moon had passed over the house, silent
as death, and it had just stopped, a round smolder — stopped on the ﬂat
roof just as if on a stranger's property —

that is the why the dog was so horror—stricken, because dogs believe in
thieves and ghosts. And when I heard it howl like this again, I felt pity
once more.

Where now was the dwarf? And the gateway? And the spider? And all
the whispering? Was I dreaming? Was I waking? I stood all of a sudden
among wild cliffs, alone, desolate, in the most desolate moonlight.

But there lay a human heiug! And there! The dog jumping, bristling,
whining — now it saw me coming — then it howled again, it sereameol: had
I ever heard a dog scream like this for help?

126

Thirol Part



And truly, I saw something the like of which I had never seen before.
A young shepherd I saw; writhing, choking, twitching, his face distorted,
with a thick black snake hanging from his mouth.

Had I ever seen so much nausea and pale dread in one face? Surely he
must have fallen asleep? Then the snake crawled into his throat — where
it bit down ﬁrmly.

My hand tore at the snake and tore — in vain! It could not tear the snake
from his throat. Then it cried out of me: “Bite down! Bite down!

Bite off the head! Bite down!” — Thus it cried out of me, my dread, my
hatred, my nausea, my pity, all my good and bad cried out of me with one
shout. —

You bold ones around me! You searchers, researchers and whoever
among you ever shipped out with cunning sails onto unexplored seas!
You riddle—happy ones!

Now guess me this riddle that I saw back then, now interpret me this
vision of the loneliest one!

For it was a vision and a foreseeing: what did I see then as a parable?
And who is it that must some day come?

W ho is the shepherd into whose throat the snake crawled this way? Who
is the human being into whose throat everything that is heaviest, blackest
Will crawl?

— Meanwhile the shepherd bit down as my shout advised him; he bit
with a good bite! Far away he spat the head of the snake — and he leaped
to his feet. —

No longer shepherd, no longer human — a transformed, illuminated,
laughing being!

Never yet on earth had I heard a human being laugh as he laughed!

Oh my brothers, I heard a laughter that was no human laughter — and
now a thirst gnaws at me, a longing that will never be still.

My longing for this laughter gnaws at me; oh how can I bear to go on
living! And how could I bear to die now! —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Unwilling Bliss

With such riddles and bitterness in his heart Zarathustra traveled across
the sea. But when he was four days removed from the blessed isles and

127

Thus S polee Zara thustra



from his friends, he had overcome all of his pain: triumphant and with
ﬁrm footing he stood once again upon his destiny. And then Zarathustra
spoke thus to his jubilating conscience:

I am alone again and want to be, alone with pure sky and open sea; and
again it is afternoon around me.

In the afternoon I once found my friends for the ﬁrst time, in
the afternoon then a second time: at the hour when all light grows
stiller.

For whatever happiness is still underway between sky and earth, it now
seeks shelter for itself in a bright soul: out of happiness now all light has
become stiller.

Oh afternoon of my life! Once my happiness too climbed to the valley
to seek itself a shelter; there it found these open, hospitable souls.

Oh afternoon of my life! What have I not given up to have this one
thing: this lively plantation of my thoughts and this morning light of my
highest hope!

Companions the creator once sought and children of his hope, and
truly, it turned out that he could not ﬁnd them unless he ﬁrst created
them himself.

And so I am in the middle of my work, going to my children and return—
ing from them; for the sake of his children Zarathustra must complete
himself.

For at bottom one loves only one's own child and work; and where
there is great love for oneself it is the hallmark of pregnancy — this is what
I found.

My children are still greening in their ﬁrst spring, standing close to
one another and shaken by a common wind, the trees of my garden and
best plot of soil.

And truly, where such trees stand next to one another, there are blessed
isles!

But at some point I want to dig them up and set each one apart, so that
it learns solitude and deﬁance and caution.

Gnarled and crooked and with pliant hardness it shall stand then beside
the sea, a living lighthouse of invincible life.

There, where the storms plunge down into the sea and the mountain's
trunk drinks water, there each one shall someday have his day and night
watches, for his own testing and knowledge.

128

Thirol Part



He shall be known and tested as to whether he is of my kind and kin —
whether he is the master of a long will, taciturn even when he speaks, and
yielding in such a way that he talees in giving —

— so that he might one day become my companion and a fellow creator
and fellow celebrator of Zarathustra: the kind who writes my will on my
tablets for the fuller completion of all things.

And for his sake and his kind I must complete myself; therefore I now
avoid my happiness and offer myself to all unhappiness — for my ultimate
testing and knowledge.

And truly, it was time that I left, and the wanderer's shadow and the
bitterest boredom and the stillest hour — all of them said to me: “it is high
time!”

The wind blew through my keyhole and said: “come
open slyly and said: “go!”

But I lay chained to the love of my children; desire set this snare for
me, desire for love, that I might become the prey of my children and lose
myself to them.

Desire — to me that means: to have lost myself. I have you, my ehiltlreh!
In this having, everything shall be certain and nothing shall be desire.

But the sun lay brooding on my love, and Zarathustra cooked in his
own juice — then shadows and doubts ﬂew over and past me.

I craved frost and winter: “Oh if only frost and winter made me snap
and crunch again!” I sighed — then icy fog rose up out of me.

My past broke open its graves; many a pain that had been buried
alive awakened — it had merely had a good night's sleep, hidden in burial
shrouds.

Thus everything cried out to me in signs: “it is time!” — But I — did not
hear. Until at last my abyss stirred and my thought bit me.

Oh, abysmal thought, you who are my thought! When will I ﬁnd the
strength to hear you digging without trembling?

My heart pounds all the way up to my head when I hear you digging!
Even your silence wants to strangle me, you abysmally silent one!

Never yet have I dared to summon you up; it is enough that I carried
you around with me! As yet I have not been strong enough for the lion's
ﬁnal overreaching and cheeky mischief.

Your gravity alone was always terrible enough for me; but one day I
shall yet ﬁnd the strength and the lion's voice to summon you up!

I”

The door sprang

129

Thus S polee Zara thustra



When I have once overcome that challenge, then I want to overcome
one still greater; and a triumph shall be the seal of my completion! —

Meanwhile I still drift on uncertain seas; accident ﬂatters me with its
smooth tongue, and though I look forward and backward, I still see no
end.

As yet the hour of my ﬁnal struggle has not come — or does it come just
now? Indeed, with treacherous beauty the surrounding sea and life gaze
at me!

Oh afternoon of my life! Oh happiness before evening! Oh harbor on
the high sea! Oh peace in uncertainty! How I mistrust you all!

Indeed, I am mistrustful of your treacherous beauty! I resemble the
lover who mistrusts the all too velvety smile.

As he pushes his most beloved before him, tender even in his hardness,
the jealous one — so too I push this blissful hour before me.

Away with you, you blissful hour! Along with you an unwilling bliss
came to me. Willing to take my deepest pain I stand here: you came at the
wrong time!

Away with you, you blissful hour! Rather take shelter there — with my
children! Hurry! And bless them before evening with my happiness!

The evening is coming now, the sun is sinking. Gone — my
happiness! —

Thus spoke Zarathustra. And he waited for his unhappiness the whole
night, but he waited in vain. The night remained bright and still, and
happiness itselfcame closer and closer to him. Toward morning, however,
Zarathustra laughed in his heart and said mockingly: “Happiness chases
after me, and that is because I do not chase after women. But happiness
is a woman.”

Before S uhrise

Oh sky above me, you pure, you deep one! You abyss of light! Gazing at
you I shudder with godlike desires.

To hurl myself into your height — that is my depth! To hide myself in
your purity — that is my innocence.

The god is veiled by his beauty; thus you conceal your stars. You do
not speak; thus you make your wisdom known to me.

Mutely you rose for me today over the roaring sea, your love and your
modesty speak revelation to my roaring soul.

130

Thirol Part



That you came to me beautiful, veiled in your beauty; that you speak
to me mutely, revealed in your wisdom —

oh how could I not guess all that is modesty in your soul! Before the
sun you came to me, the loneliest one.

We are friends from the beginning; we have grief and ghastliness and
ground in common; even the sun we have in common.

We do not speak to one another because we know too much: we are
silent to one another, we smile our knowledge to one another.

Are you not the light to my ﬁre? Do you not have the sister soul to my
insight?

Together we learned everything; together we learned to climb up to
ourselves by climbing over ourselves, and to smile cloudlessly:

— smile down cloudlessly from bright eyes and from a distance of miles,
when beneath us pressure and purpose and guilt steam like rain.

And if I wandered alone — for whom did my soul thirst in nights and
on wrong paths? And if I climbed mountains, whom did I ever seek if not
you on mountains?

And all my wandering and mountain climbing: they were only a neces—
sity and a help to the helpless one — the only thing my will wants is to ﬂy,
to ﬂy into you!

And whom did I hate more than drifting clouds and everything that
stains you? And I hated even my own hatred because it stained you!

I grudge these drifting clouds, these creeping predator—cats; they take
from you and me what we have in common — our awesome inﬁnite saying
of Yes and Amen.

We grudge these middle—men and mixers, these drifting clouds, these
half—and—halfs who learned neither to bless, nor to curse whole heartedly.

I would rather sit in a barrel under a closed sky, would rather sit in an
abyss without sky than see you, sky of light, stained by drifting clouds!

And often I wanted to tie them together with the jagged gold wires of
lightning, and beat their kettle bellies like thunder —

— an angry kettle drummer because they rob me of your Yes! and
Amen! — you sky above me, you pure, you bright one! You abyss of light! —
Because they rob you of my Yes! and Amen!

For I would rather have din and thunder and stormy cursing than
this deliberate, dubious cat calm; and even among humans the ones I
hate most are the soft steppers and half—and—halfs and dubious, dawdling
drift—clouds.

131

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And “whoever cannot bless, let him learn to curse!” — this bright teach—
ing fell to me from the bright sky, this star stands in my sky even in black
nights.

I am a blesser and a Yes—sayer if only you are around me, you pure, you
bright one, you abyss of light! Into all abysses then I carry my Yes—saying
that blesses.

I have become a blesser and a Yes—sayer, and for this I wrestled long
and was a wrestler, in order to free my hands one day for blessing.

But this is my blessing: to stand over each thing as its own sky, as its
round roof, its azure bell and eternal security — and blessed is he who
blesses so!

For all things are baptized at the well of eternity and beyond good and
evil; good and evil themselves, however, are only shadows in between and
damp glooms and drift—clouds.

Truly it is a blessing and no blasphemy when I teach: “Over all things
stands the sky accident, the sky innocence, the sky chance, the sky mis—
chief.”

“By chance” — that is the oldest nobility in the world, I gave it back to
all things, I redeemed them from their servitude under purpose.

This freedom and cheerfulness of the sky I placed like an azure bell
over all things when I taught that over them and through them no “eternal
will” — wills.

This mischief and this folly I placed in place of that will when I taught:
“With all things one thing is impossible — rationality!”

A hit of reason to be sure, a seed of wisdom sprinkled from star to star —
this sourdough is mixed into all things: for the sake of folly, wisdom is
mixed into all things!

A bit of wisdom is indeed possible; but I found this blessed cer—
tainty in all things: that on the feet of accident they would rather —
dame.

Oh sky above me, you pure, you exalted one! This your purity is to me
now, that there is no eternal spider and spider web of reason:

— that you are my dance ﬂoor for divine accident, that you are my gods'
table for divine dice throws and dice players! —

But you blush? Did I speak the unspeakable? Did I blaspheme when I
wanted to bless you?

Or is it the shame of us two that made you blush? — Do you command
me to go and be silent because now — the day is coming?

132

Thirol Part



The world is deep — and deeper than the day has ever grasped. Not
everything may be permitted to speak before day. But the day is coming,
and so let us part now!

Oh sky above me, you bashful, you glowing one! Oh you my happiness
before sunrise! The day is coming, and so let us part now! —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh Virtue that Malees Small

1

When Zarathustra was on dry land again he did not go directly to his
mountains and his cave, but instead took many ways and asked many
questions and found out about this and that, saying of himself jokingly:
“Look at the river that ﬂows back to its source in many windings!” For
he wanted to learn what had transpired in the meantime among human
heihgs; whether they had become bigger or smaller. And once he saw a
row of new houses, and he was amazed then and he said:

“What do these houses mean? Truly, no great soul placed them here,
as a parable of itself!

Probably some feeble—minded child took them out of its toy box? If
only another child would put them back into its toy box!

And these parlors and chambers; can men go in and out here? To me
they seem made for satin dolls, or for nibblers who probably let themselves
be nibbled.”

And Zarathustra stood still and reﬂected. At last he said sadly: “Every—
thing has become smaller!

Everywhere I see lower gateways; whoever is like me can still pass
through, but — he has to stoop!

Oh when will I return to my homeland where I no longer have to stoop —
no longer have to stoop hefore the small ones!” — And Zarathustra sighed
and gazed into the distance. —

On the same day, however, he delivered his speech on virtue that makes
small.

I walk among these people and keep my eyes open; they do not forgive
me that I am not envious of their Virtues.

133

Thus S polee Zara thustra



They bite at me because I say to them: for small people small virtues
are necessary — and because I ﬁnd it hard to grasp that small people are
necessary!

I still resemble the rooster here in a strange barnyard, whom even the
hens bite; and yet I am not bad to the hens because of that.

I am courteous toward them as toward all small annoyances; to be
prickly toward what is small strikes me as wisdom for porcupines.

They all talk about me when they sit around the ﬁre evenings — they
talk about me, but no one thinks — about me!

This is the new stillness that I learned: their noise concerning me
spreads a cloak over my thoughts.

They make noise among themselves: “What does this dark cloud want
with us? Let's see to it that it does not bring us a plague!”

And recently a woman snatched her child to herself, who wanted to
come to me: “Take the children away!” she shouted. “Such eyes singe
children's souls.”

They cough when I speak, they think that coughing is an objection to
strong wind — they guess nothing of the roaring of my happiness!

“We still have no time for Zarathustra” — thus they object; but what
does any time matter which “has no time” for Zarathustra?

And even if they were to praise me, how could I fall asleep on their
praise? Their praise is a belt of thorns to me; it scratches me even when
I take it off.

And this also I learned among them: the one who praises pretends that
he is giving back, but in truth he wants to be given even more!

Ask my foot whether it likes their tune of praise and palaver! Indeed,
to such a beat and tick—tock it wants neither to dance nor to stand
still.

They want to palaver and praise me to their small virtue; they would
like to persuade my foot to the tick—tock of their small happiness.

I walk among these people and keep my eyes open; they have become
smaller and are becoming ever smaller: hut this is heeause of their teaching
on happiness and virtue.

For they are modest even in their virtue — because they want content—
ment. But only modest virtue goes along with contentment.

Even they, of course, learn to stride and to stride forward in their way —
this is what I call their hohhliug. This way they become an obstacle to
anyone who is in a hurry.

Thirol Part



And some of them look backward stiff—necked while walking forward;
these I like to run into.

Foot and eye should not lie, nor rub each other's faces in their lies. But
there is much lying among the small people.

A few of them will, but most of them are merely willed. A few of them
are genuine, but most of them are bad actors.

There are unknowing actors among them and unwilling actors among
them — the genuine are always rare, especially the genuine actors.

There is little here of the man, therefore their women masculinize
themselves. For only he who is man enough will redeem the woman in
woman.

And this hypocrisy I found to be the worst among them; that even those
who command feign the virtues of those who serve.

“I serve, you serve, we serve” — this is how even the hypocrisy of
the rulers prays here — and watch out if the ﬁrst lord is only the ﬁrst
servant!

Oh, into their hypocrisies too the curiosity of my eyes ﬂew astray, and
well did I guess all their ﬂy—happiness and their buzzing around sunny
windowpanes.

So much kindness, so much weakness I see. So much justice and pity,
so much weakness.

Round, righteous and kind they are to one another, like grains of sand
are round, righteous and kind to one another.

To modestly embrace a small happiness — that they call “resignation”
and already they are squinting around modestly for a new small happiness.

At bottom these simple ones want one simple thing: that no one harm
them. And so they beat everyone to it by doing them a good deed.

But this is eowaroliee, even if it is called “virtue.” —

And if they ever speak grufﬂy, these small people, I hear only their
hoarseness — for every puff of wind makes them hoarse.

They are clever, and their virtues have clever ﬁngers. But they lack
ﬁsts; their ﬁngers do not know how to form into ﬁsts.

To them virtue is whatever makes modest and tame; this is how they
made the wolf into a dog and mankind himself into mankind's favorite
pet.

“We place our chair in the middle” — that is what their grinning says to
me — “and just as far away from dying ﬁghters as from contented sows.”

But this is — mediocrity: even if it is called moderation. —

I walk among these people and let many a word fall, but they know neither
to take nor to keep.

They are amazed that I did not come to lambast lusting and malignancy,
and truly, nor did I come to warn of pick—pockets!

They are amazed that I am not prepared to make their cleverness
wittier and prettier, as if they did not have enough cleverlings already,
whose voices scrape me like chalk on slate!

And when I shout: “A curse on all cowardly devils in you, who like to
whine and fold their hands and worship,” then they shout: “Zarathustra
is godless.”

And especially their teachers of resignation shout it — but they are
precisely the ones into whose ears I like to shout: “Yes! I am Zarathustra,
the godless one!”

These teachers of resignation! Wherever there is pettiness and sickness
and scabs, they crawl to it like lice; and only my disgust prevents me from
cracking them.

Well then! This is my sermon for their ears: I am Zarathustra, the
godless, who says: “Who is more godless than I, so that I can enjoy his
instruction?”

I am Zarathustra, the godless: where do I ﬁnd my equal? And all those
are my equal who give themselves their own will and put aside all resig—
nation.

I am Zarathustra, the godless: I still cook every chance in my pot. And
only when it has been well cooked in there do I welcome it as my food.

And truly, many a chance came to me imperiously, but my will spoke
to it even more imperiously — and already it lay begging on its knees —

— begging me for protection and affection and addressing me with
ﬂattery: “Look, oh Zarathustra, it's only a friend coming to a friend!” —

But why do I speak where no one has my ears! And so I want to shout
it out to the four winds:

You are becoming smaller and smaller, you small people! You are crum—
bling, you contented ones! You will yet perish —

— of your many small virtues, of your many small abstentions, of your
many small resignations!

Too sparing, too yielding — that is your soil! But in order for a tree to
grow tall, it needs to put down hard roots amid hard rock!

136

Thirol Part



And even what you abstain from weaves at the web of all future
humanity; even your nothing is a spider web and a spider that lives off
the blood of the future.

And when you take, it's like stealing, you small—virtued ones; and even
among rogues hohor says: “One should only steal where one can not
rob.”

“It will give” — that too is a teaching of resignation. But I say to you
contented people: it will talee and it will take more and more from you!

Oh if only you would put aside all halfwilling and become as resolute
in your sloth as in your deeds!

Oh if only you understood my words: “Go ahead and do whatever you
will — but ﬁrst be the kind of people who can will!

Go ahead and love your neighbors as you love yourselves — but ﬁrst be
the kind of people who love themselves —

love with the great love, love with the great contempt!” Thus speaks
Zarathustra the godless. —

But why do I speak where no one has my ears! Here it is still one hour
too early for me.

I am my own forerunner among these people, my own cock—crow
through dark lanes.

But their hour is coming! And mine will come too! By the hour they
become smaller, poorer, more sterile — poor weeds! Poor soil!

And soon they shall stand there before me like parched grass and steppe,
and truly, weary of themselves — and yearning for ﬁre more than for water!

Oh blessed hour of lightning! Oh secret before noon! — Wild ﬁres I
want to make of them some day and heralds with tongues of ﬁre —

— some day they shall proclaim with tongues of ﬁre: It is coming, it is
near, the great hooh!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Mount ofOlives

The winter, a wicked guest, sits in my house; my hands are blue from his
friendly handshake.

I honor him, this wicked guest, but I gladly let him sit alone. Gladly I
run away from him, and if one runs well, then one can escape him!

With warm feet and warm thoughts I run to where the wind is calm —
to the sunny spot of my mount of olives.

I37

Thus S polee Zara thustra



There I laugh at my ﬁerce guest and still think well of him for catching
the ﬂies in my house and silencing much small noise.

For he does not tolerate it when a mosquito or two wants to sing;
he also makes the lane so lonely that the moonlight is afraid in it at
night.

A hard guest is he — but I honor him, and I do not pray to the pot—bellied
ﬁre idol like the weaklings.

Rather a bit of teeth chattering than worshiping idols — that is how
my kind wants it! And I especially grudge all horny, steamy, musty ﬁre
idols.

Whomever I love, I love better in winter than in summer; better and
more heartily I now mock my enemies since winter sits at home with
me.

Heartily indeed, even when I trawl to bed — then even my hiding
happiness laughs and makes mischief; even my lying dream laughs.

I, a crawler? Never in my life have I crawled before the mighty; and if
I ever lied, then I lied out of love. That is why I am cheerful even in my
winter bed.

A meager bed warms me more than a rich one, for I am jealous of my
poverty, and in winter it is most faithful to me.

Each day I begin with a malice; I mock winter with a cold bath — that
makes my ﬁerce house guest growl.

I also like to tickle him with a little wax candle, so that ﬁnally he will
release the sky from ashen grey twilight.

In the morning I am especially malicious, in the early hour when the
pail clatters at the well and the horses whinny warmly through grey
lanes:

Impatiently I wait for the bright sky to open at last, the snow—bearded
winter sky, the old man and white—head —

— the winter sky, the silent one who often keeps even his sun silent!

Did I learn my long bright silence from him? Or did he learn it from
me? Or did each of us invent it on his own?

The origin of all good things is thousandfold — all good mischievous
things leap for joy into existence: so how are they supposed to do this —
only once?

Long silence too is a good mischievous thing, and looking out of a
round—eyed face like the winter sky —

138

Thirol Part



— to be silent like the winter sky about one's sun and one's uncom—
promising solar will: indeed, this art and this winter mischief I learned
well!

My favorite malice and art is that my silence learned not to betray itself
through silence.

Rattling with diction and dice I outwit the solemn waiting ones; my
will and purpose shall elude all these ﬁerce watchers.

To prevent anyone from looking down into my ground and ultimate
will, I invented my long bright silence.

Many a clever one I found, who veiled his face and muddied his water
so that no one could see through him and down into him.

But precisely to him came the more clever mistrustful ones and nut
crackers; precisely his most hidden ﬁsh they ﬁshed out of him!

But to me the bright, courageous, transparent ones are the most clever
of those who keep silent; those whose ground is so deep that even the
brightest water does not — betray it.

You snow—bearded silent winter sky, you round—eyed white—head above
me! Oh you heavenly parable of my soul and its mischief!

And must I not conceal myself like someone who has swallowed gold —
so that they do not slit open my soul?

Must I not wear stilts so that they overloole my long legs — all these plain
jealous and pain zealous who surround me?

These smoky, room—temperature, used up, greened—out, grief ridden
souls — how eoulol their envy bear my happiness!

And so I show them only the ice and the winter on my peaks — and hot
that my mountain winds all the belts of the sun around itself!

They hear only my winter storms whistling, and hot that I also glide
over warm seas like longing, heavy, sultry south winds.

They still have mercy on my accidents and coincidences: but my words
say: “Let accident come to me: it is innocent, like a little child!”

How eoulol they bear my happiness if I did not cover my happiness
with accidents and winter emergencies and polar bear caps and snow—sky
sheets?

— If I myself didn't have mercy on their pity: the pity of these who are
plain jealous and pain zealous!

— If I myself didn't sigh before them, teeth chattering, and patiently
allow myself to be wrapped in their pity!

I39

Thus S polee Zara thustra



It is the wise mischief and benevolence of my soul that it tloes hot eoheeal
its winter and its ice storms; nor does it conceal its frostbites.

One person's loneliness is the escape of the sick; another's loneliness
is the escape from the sick.

Let them hear me chatter and sigh from winter cold, all these wretched,
leering rascals around me! With such sighing and chatteringI still escape
their heated rooms.

Let them sympathize and sympasigh2 about my frostbite: “He will
freeze yet from the ice of knowledge!” — so they lament.

Meanwhile I run with warm feet crisscross on my mount of olives; in
the sunny spot of my mount of olives I sing and mock all pitying. —

Thus sang Zarathustra.

011 Passing By

In this manner, hiking slowly through many peoples and towns,
Zarathustra returned the long way to his mountains and his cave. And
then, unexpectedly, he also arrived at the gate of the hig eity. Here, how—
ever, a foaming fool with outstretched hands leaped toward him and
blocked his path. And this was the same fool whom the people called
“Zarathustra's ape,” because he had memorized some of the phrasing
and tone of Zarathustra's speaking and also liked to borrow from the
treasure of his wisdom. The fool spoke thus to Zarathustra:

“Oh Zarathustra, this is the big city: here you have nothing to gain and
everything to lose.

Why do you want to wade through this mud? Have pity on your feet!
Spit on the city gate instead and — turn around!

Here is hell for hermit's thoughts; here great thoughts are boiled alive
and cooked till they are small.

Here all great feelings rot; here only tiny, rattlebone feelings are allowed
to rattle!

Do you not already smell the slaughter houses and kitchens of the spirit?
Does this town not steam with the reek of slaughtered spirit?

2 “Mogen sie mich bemitleiden und bemitseufzen ob meiner Frostbeulen” 7 playful coinages such as
bemitseufzen, ofwhich there are several in TSZ, can often seem alienating and outrageous to readers
of German, and clearly this was Nietzsche‘s intention: Though very difﬁcult to translate, and
frequently accompanied by internal rhyme, alliteration, and other lyrical devices, these vivacious
puns and coinages nonetheless deserve an attempt on the translators part:

Do you not see the souls hanging like limp dirty rags? — And they even
make newspapers out of these rags!

Do you not hear how the spirit here turned into wordplay? It vomits
dirty dish—word water! — And they even make newspapers out of this dirty
dish—word water.

They hurry each other and know not where to. They heat each other up
and know not why. They jingle with their tin, they jangle with their
gold.

They are cold and they seek warmth in distilled liquors; they are over—
heated and seek coolness in frozen spirits; they are all sick and addicted
to public opinion.

All lusting and malignancy are at home here; but here there are also
Virtuous types, there is much effective and affected virtue: —

Much effective virtue with scribble ﬁngers and hard sit—and—wait ﬂesh,
blessed with little stars on their chests and padded fannyless daughters.

There is also much piety here and much devout spittle lick quaking
and ﬂatter cake baking before the God of Hosts.

‘From on high' the star trickles down, and the merciful spittle; every
starless chest meanwhile longs to get up high.

The moon has its farm, and the farm has its mooncalves; but the
beggarly people and all effective beggarly virtue pray to everything that
comes from the farm.

‘I serve, you serve, we serve' — so begs all effective virtue to the prince,
hoping that the deserved star will ﬁnally cling to the narrow chest!

But the moon still revolves around all that is earthly, and the prince
too still revolves around what is most earthly — and that is the gold of the
shopkeepers.

The God of Hosts is no God of gold bars; the prince proposes, but the
shopkeeper — disposes!

By all that is bright and strong and good in you, oh Zarathustra, spit
on this city of the shopkeepers and turn around!

Here all blood ﬂows tainted and tepid and frothy decrepit through all
veins; spit on the big city which is the big scum trap where all spumy crap
spumes together!

Spit on this city of broken down souls and narrow chests, of prying
eyes, of sticky ﬁngers —

— on this city of the obtrusive, the insolent, the pencil— and roughnecks,
the overheated and ambition eaten:

141

Thus S polee Zara thustra



— where everything that is crumbly, corrupted, lusty, dusky, overly
mushy and pussy festers together confederately: —

— spit on the big city and turn around!” —

At this point, however, Zarathustra interrupted the foaming fool and
clapped his hand over the fool's mouth.

“Stop at last!” cried Zarathustra. “Your speech and your ways have
nauseated me for a long time already!

Why have you lived so long near the swamp, that you yourself had to
turn into a frog and a toad?

Doesn't tainted and frothy, decrepit swamp blood ﬂow in your own
veins now, since you have learned to croak and lambast this way?

Why didn't you go into the woods? Or plow the earth? Isn't the sea full
of green islands?

I despise your despising; and if you warned me — why didn't you warn
yourself?

Out of love alone shall my despising and my warning bird ﬂy up: but
not out of the swamp! —

They call you my ape, you foaming fool; but I call you my grunting
swine — by grunting you will yet spoil my praise of folly.

What was it after all that made you start grunting? That no one ﬂa ttereol
you enough — so you sat down to this garbage in order to have reason to
grunt a lot —

— in order to have reason for a lot of revenge! Indeed, all your foaming
is revenge, you vain fool; I guessed you well!

But your fool's words injure me, even where you are right! And if
Zarathustra's words were right even a hundred times: you would always
do wrong with my words!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra, and he looked at the big city, sighed, and kept
silent for a long time. Finally he spoke thus:

“I am nauseated too by this big city and not only by this fool. Here as
there nothing can be bettered, nothing can be worsened.

Woe to this big city! — And I wish I already saw the pillar of ﬁre in
Which it Will burn!

For such pillars of ﬁre must precede the great noon. But this has its
own time and its own destiny. —

Meanwhile, you fool, I give you this lesson in parting: where one can
no longer love, there one should — pass hy!” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra and he passed by the fool and the big city.

On A posta tes

I

Alas, does everything lie wilted and grey that only recently stood green
and colorful in this meadow? And how much honey of hope I carried from
here to my beehives!

All these young hearts have already grown old — and not even old! Only
weary, common, comfortable — as they put it: “We have become pious
again.”

Just recently I saw them set out by early morning on brave feet, but their
feet of knowledge grew weary, and now they slander even their braveness
of the morning!

Truly, many a one used to raise his legs like a dancer; the laughter in
my wisdom beckoned to him — then he reconsidered. Just now I saw him
crooked — and crawling to the cross.

Once they ﬂuttered around light and freedom like gnats and young
poets. A bit older, a bit colder, and already they monger rumors in the
dark, thronging around the stove.

Did their hearts falter perhaps because solitude swallowed me like a
whale? Did their ears listen perhaps longingly long in vain for me and my
trumpet and herald calls?

Too bad! Those whose hearts have long courage and encourage mischief
are always few; and in such the spirit too remains patient. But the rest are
eowarolly.

The rest: these are always the most by far, the day to day, the superﬂuous,
the far—too—many — all of these are cowardly!

Whoever is of my kind also encounters my kind of experiences
along the way, so that his ﬁrst companions have to be corpses and
jesters.

His second companions, however — they will call themselves his
helievers: a living swarm, much love, much folly, much beardless ven—
eration.

Whoever is of my kind among human beings should not tie his heart to
these believers; whoever knows capricious, cowardly humankind should
not believe in these spring times and colorful meadows!

If they eoulol do otherwise, then they would also will otherwise. Half—
and—halfs spoil all that is whole. That leaves will wilt — what is to be
lamented here!

I43

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Let them ﬂy and fall, oh Zarathustra, and do not lament! Better yet
blow among them with rustling wind —

— blow among these leaves, oh Zarathustra, so that everything wilteol
runs away from you even faster! —

2

“We have become pious again” — so these apostates confess, and some of
them are still too cowardly to confess in this manner.

I look them in the eye — I tell them to their faces and to their blushing
cheeks: You are the kind who pray again!

But it is a disgrace to pray! Not for everyone, but for you and me and
whoever still has a conscience in his head. For you it is a disgrace to pray!

You know it well; your cowardly devil in you, who likes to fold his hands
and lay his hands in his lap and wants to have it easier — this cowardly
devil exhorts you: “There is a God!”

W ith that however you belong to the shade—loving variety who are never
left in peace by light; now every day you must stick your head deeper into
night and mist!

And truly, you chose the hour well, for just now the night birds are
ﬂying out. The hour has come for all shade—loving folk, the evening and
commemoration hour when they do not “commemorate.”

I hear and smell it: their hour came for the hunt and the procession, not
for a wild hunt, to be sure, but for a tame, lame, snooping, up—buttering
prayer muttering hunt —

— for a hunt for soulful mousy yes—men; all the heart's mousetraps have
now been set again! And wherever I lift a curtain, a little night moth comes
ﬂuttering out.

Did it perhaps crouch there with another little night moth? For every—
where I smell little communities that have crept away; and where there
are little rooms there are new Holy Joes in them and the reek of Holy

Joes.
They sit long evenings together and say: “Let us become as little chil—
dren again and say ‘dear God'!” — their mouths and stomachs ruined by

pious confectioners.

Or they watch long evenings the cunning lurking cross spider, which
preaches cleverness to the spiders themselves and thus teaches: “There
is good spinning among crosses!”

I44

Thirol Part



Or they sit the whole day with ﬁshing rods at swamps and consider
themselves deep for doing so; but whoever ﬁshes where there are no ﬁsh
— him I cannot even call superﬁcial!

Or they learn piously, joyously to stroke the harp, from a writer of songs
who would gladly harp his way into the hearts of little young women —
having grown weary of the little old women and their praise.

Or they learn to shudder from a learned half—madman who waits in
dark rooms for the spirits to come to him — and for the spirit to run away
altogether!

Or they listen to an old wandering harebrained whistler, who learned
the triste of tones from tristful winds; now he whistles after the wind and
preaches triste in tristful tones.

And some of them have even become night watchmen; now they know
how to blow into their horns and go around at night waking up old things
that have long ago gone to sleep.

I heard ﬁve expressions of old things yesterday night at the garden wall —
they came from such old, saddened, dried up night watchmen.

“For a father he doesn't care enough about his children: human fathers
do this better!” —

“He is too old! He does not even care about his children at all anymore” —
thus answered the other night watchman.

“Does he even have children? No one can prove it, if he himself
doesn't prove it! I wish he would just go ahead and prove it properly for
once.”

“Prove it? As if he had ever proven anything! Proving is hard for him;
he treasures instead that people have faith in him.”

“Indeed! Indeed! Faith makes him blessed, faith in him. That's just the
way of old people! That's how it is with us too!” —

— Thus the two old night watchmen and light Chasers spoke to one
another, and they tooted their horns sadly; so it was yesterday at the
garden wall.

But my heart convulsed with laughter and wanted to break and did not
know what next, and it sank into my diaphragm.

Indeed, this will be the death of me, that I choke from laughter when I
see asses drunk and hear night watchmen doubting God's existence like
this.

Has the time not long since past even for all such doubting? Who is
allowed anymore to wake up such old, sleeping, shade—loving things!

145

Thus S polee Zara thustra



It has been over for the old gods for a long time now — and truly, they
had a good cheerful gods' end!

They did not “twilight” themselves to death — that is surely a lie!
Instead, they just one day up and laugheol themselves to death!

This happened when the most godless words were uttered by a god
himself — the words: “There is one god. Thou shalt have no other god
before me!” —

— an old grim—beard of a god, a jealous one forgot himself in this way:

And all the gods laughed then and rocked in their chairs and cried: “Is
godliness not precisely that there are gods but no God?”

He who has ears to hear, let him hear. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra in the town that he loved and which is called
The Motley Cow. From here he had only two more days to go to return to
his cave and his animals, and his soul jubilated constantly at the nearness
of his homecoming. —

The Homecoming

Oh solitude! Oh you my home solitude! I lived wild too long in wild foreign
lands to not return to you with tears!

Now go ahead and threaten me with your ﬁnger, like mothers threaten;
now smile at me, like mothers smile; now say to me: “And who was it that
once stormed out on me like a storm wind? —

— who called out in leaving: ‘too long have I sat with solitude, and I
have forgotten how to keep silent!' That — you have learned now?

Oh Zarathustra, I know everything, and that you were more forsaleeh
among the many, you solitary one, than ever with me!

Being forsaken is one thing, solitude is another: that — you have now
learned! And that among human beings you will always be wild and
foreign.

Wild and foreign even when they love you; for what they want above
all is to be spared!

But here you are in your own home and house; here you can speak
everything out and pour out all the reasons, nothing here is ashamed of
obscure, obstinate feelings.

Here all things come caressingly to your rhetoric and they ﬂatter you,
for they want to ride on your back. Here you ride on every parable to
every truth.

146

Thirol Part



Here you may speak uprightly and forthrightly to all things, and truly,
it rings like praise in their ears that someone talks straight with all
things!

But being forsaken is another matter. For do you still recall, oh
Zarathustra, when your bird called above you, when you stood in the
woods, hesitating about which way to go, close to a corpse? —

When you spoke: ‘May my animals guide me! I found it more dangerous
among human beings than among animals' — that was forsaken!

And do you still recall, oh Zarathustra, when you sat on your island,
a well of wine among empty buckets, giving and giving away, among the
thirsty bestowing and ﬂowing:

— until at last you alone sat thirsty among the drunk and lamented at
night: ‘is receiving not more blessed than giving? And stealing even more
blessed than receiving?' — That was forsaken!

And do you still recall, oh Zarathustra, when your stillest hour came
and drove you away from yourself, when with evil whispers it said: ‘Speak
and break!' —

— when it made you sorry for all your waiting and silence and discour—
aged your cautious courage: that was forsaken!” —

Oh solitude! You my home solitude! How blissfully and tenderly your
voice speaks to me!

We do not implore one another, we do not deplore one another, we walk
openly with one another through open doors.3

For at your house it is open and bright, and even the hours run here on
lighter feet. In darkness, after all, time is heavier to bear than in the light.

Here all of being's words and word shrines burst open; here all being
wants to become word, here all becoming wants to learn from me how to
speak.

But down there — there all speaking is in vain! There forgetting and
passing by are the best wisdom: that — I have now learned!

Whoever wanted to comprehend everything among human beings
would have to apprehend everything. But for that my hands are too
clean.

I cannot stand even to inhale their breath; too bad that I have lived so
long among their noise and bad breath!



Oh blissful silence around me! Oh clean fragrances around me ! Oh
how this silence takes a deep clean breath! Oh how it listens, this blissful
silence!

But down there — everyone talks there, everyone is ignored there. One
could ring in his wisdom with bells, and the shopkeepers in the market
place would jingle it out with pennies.

Everyone talks among them, no one knows any more how to understand.
Everything falls in the water, nothing falls anymore into deep wells.

Everyone talks among them, nothing works out anymore and comes to
an end. Everyone cackles, but who wants to sit still in the nest anymore
and hatch eggs?

Everyone talks among them, everything gets talked to death. And what—
ever was still too hard yesterday for time itself and for its tooth, today it
hangs scraped up and chewed up from the snouts of today's people.

Everyone talks among them, everything is betrayed. And what was
once called secret and secrecy of deep souls, today it belongs to the street
trumpeters and other butterﬂies.

Oh human nature, you strange thing! You noise in dark lanes! Now you
lie behind me again — my greatest danger lies behind me!

In sparing and pitying my greatest danger always lay; and all human
nature wants to be spared and pitied.

With concealed truths, with a fool's hand and a fooled, infatuated heart,
rich in pity's petty lies — this is how I lived among human beings.

Disguised I sat among them, ready to misjudge myself in order to
stand them, and gladly urging myself: “You fool, you do not know human
beings!”

One forgets about human beings when one lives among human beings;
there is too much foreground in all human beings — what use are far—
sighted, far—seeking eyes there!

And when they misjudged me, I, fool, spared them more than myself,
since I am accustomed to hardness, and often I even took revenge on
myself for being so sparing.

Covered in bites by poisonous ﬂies and hollowed out, like a stone, by
many drops of malice, I sat among them and still I told myself: “Everything
small is innocent of its smallness!”

Especially those who call themselves “the good,” I found to be the most
poisonous ﬂies; they sting in all innocence, they lie in all innocence — how
could they be just toward me!

148

Thirol Part



Whoever lives among the good is taught by pity to lie. Pity fouls the air
for all free souls. The stupidity of the good, after all, is unfathomable.

To conceal myself and my wealth — that is what I learned down there,
for I found each of them poor in spirit. And it was the lie of my pitying
that I knew with each one,

— that I saw and smelled with each one, what was enough spirit for him
and what was already too much!

Their stiff wise men — I call them wise, not stiff— that is how I learned
to swallow words. Their gravediggers — I called them researchers and
testers — that is how I learned to switch words.

The gravediggers dig themselves diseases. Under ancient ruins rest
noxious fumes. One should not stir up the morass. One should live on
mountains.

With blissful nostrils I once again breathe mountain freedom! My nose
is ﬁnally redeemed of the odor of all human nature!

Tickled by sharp breezes as if by sparkling wines, my soul sneezes —
sneezes and jubilates to itself: Gesuholheit!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Three Evils

I

In a dream, in the last dream of morning I stood today on a foothill —
beyond the world, holding a scale, and I weigheol the world.

But the dawn came too early, and glowed me awake, this jealous one!
She is always jealous of my morning dream embers.

Measurable for the one who has time, weighable for a good weigher,
ﬂyable for strong wings, guessable for divine nut crackers: thus my dream
found the world.

My dream, a daring sailor, halfship, halfwhirlwind, silent as butterﬂies,
impatient as falcons: how did it have the patience and while today for
world—weighing?

Did my wisdom perhaps encourage it, my laughing, waking day wis—
dom, which mocks all “inﬁnite worlds”? For it says: “Where there is force,
humher will become the master: it has more force.”

How certainly my dream looked upon this ﬁnite world, not inquisitively,
not curiously, not incuriously, not fearfully, not beseechingly:

I49

Thus S polee Zara thustra



— as if a plump apple offered itself to my hand, a ripe golden apple,
with cool soft velvety peel — thus the world offered itself to me:

— as if a tree waved to me, a broad—limbed, strong—willed tree, bent as a
support and even as a footrest for the weary traveler: thus stood the world
on my foothill:

— as if delicate hands carried a shrine toward me — a shrine open for
the delight of bashful, venerating eyes: thus the world offered itself to me
today:

— not riddle enough to chase away human love, not solution enough to
lull human wisdom to sleep — a humanly good thing the world was for me
today, of which so much evil is spoken!

How do I thank my morning dream for allowing me to weigh the world
early this morning? As a humanly good thing it came to me, this dream
and consoler of the heart!

And in order to do by day what it does, and to imitate it and learn its
best, I now want to place the three most evil things on the scale and weigh
them humanly well.

He that taught to bless here also taught to curse: what are the three
best—cursed things in the world? These I want to place on the scale.

Sex, lust to rule, selﬁshness: these three have been cursed best and slan—
dered and lied about most so far — these three I want to weigh humanly
well.

Well then! Here is my foothill and there is the sea; it rolls up to me,
shaggy, ﬂattering, the faithful old hundred—headed behemoth hound that
I love.

Well then! Here I want to hold the scale over rolling seas, and I also
choose a witness to look on — you, you hermit tree, you strongly fragrant,
broadly vaulted tree that I love!

On what bridge does the now get to the someday? By what compulsion
does the high compel itself to the low? And what commands even the
highest — to grow higher?

Now the scale stands balanced and still: three weighty questions I threw
into it, three weighty answers are borne by the other pan.

Sex: the thorn and stake of all hair—shirted body despisers, and cursed as
“world” among all hinterworldly, because it mocks and fools all teachers
of muddle and mistakes.

Sex: the slow ﬁre on which the rabble are burned, the ready rut and
rolling boil oven of all wormy wood, all stinking rags.

Sex: innocent and free for free hearts, the garden happiness of earth,
all the future's exuberant gratitude for the now.

Sex: a sweetish poison only for the wilted, but for the lion—willed a
great fortifying of the heart, and the respectfully reserved wine of wines.

Sex: the great parable—happiness for higher happiness and highest hope.
For to many marriage is promised and more than marriage —

— To many who are stranger to one another than man and woman — and
who has ever completely grasped how strange man and woman are to one
another!

Sex — but I want fences around my thoughts and around my words too,
so that the pigs and the partiers do not break into my garden! —

Lust to rule: the searing scourge of the hardest of the hard hearted,
the creepy torture that is reserved for the very cruelest person, the dark
ﬂame of living funeral pyres.

Lust to rule: the grim gadﬂy imposed on the vainest peoples, the mocker
of all insecure virtue, the rider on every horse and every pride.

Lust to rule: the earthquake that breaks and breaks open everything rot—
ten and hollow, the rolling, growling, punishing smasher of whitewashed
tombs, the ﬂashing question mark next to premature answers.

Lust to rule: before whose gaze human beings crawl and cower and
drudge and become lower than snake and swine — until at last the great
contempt cries out of them —

Lust to rule: the terrible teacher of the great contempt who preaches
“away with you!” to the faces of cities and empires — until they themselves
cry out “away With me!”

Lust to rule: which also ascends luringly to the pure and the solitary
and into self—sufﬁcient heights, glowing like a love that luringly paints
purple bliss on earth's skies.

Lust to rule: but who would call it lust when the high longs downward
for power! Indeed, there is nothing sick and addicted in such longing and
descending!

That the solitary height not isolate and sufﬁce itself eternally; that the

And it was then that it happened — indeed happened for the ﬁrst time!
— that his words pronounced selﬁshness blessed, the sound, healthy self—
ishness that wells from a powerful soul —

— from a powerful soul to which the high body belongs, the beauti—
ful, triumphant, invigorating body, around which every manner of thing
becomes mirror:

— the supple persuading body, the dancer whose parable and epitome is
the self—joyous soul. Such self—joy of body and soul calls itself: “Virtue.”

With its words of good and bad such self—joy shields itself as if with
sacred groves; with the names of its happiness it banishes from itself
everything contemptible.

From itself it banishes all that is cowardly, saying: “Bad — that is
eowarolly!” It considers contemptible those who always worry, sigh, com—
plain, and whoever picks up even the smallest advantages.

It also despises all woe—wallowing wisdom, for indeed, there is also
wisdom that blossoms in darkness, a night shadow wisdom that always
sighs: “All is vain!”

It holds shy mistrust in low esteem, and everyone who wants oaths
instead of gazes and hands; and all wisdom that is all too mistrustful —
because this is the way of cowardly souls.

Even lower it esteems those quick to please, the dog—like who lie on
their backs right away, the humble; and there is wisdom too that is humble
and dog—like and pious and quick to please.

Utterly disgusting and despicable to it are those who never
defend themselves, who swallow poisonous spittle and evil stares; the
all too patient, all—enduring, all—complacent: for they are the servile kind.

Whether a person is servile before gods and gods' kicks, or before
human beings and stupid human opinions: all servile kind it spits on, this
blissful selﬁshness!

Bad: that is what it calls everything that is struck down, stingy and
servile; fettered blinking eyes, oppressed hearts, and those false, yielding
types who kiss with broad cowardly lips.

And pseudo—wisdom: that is what it calls everything that servants and
old men and weary people witticize; and especially the whole nasty nitwit—
ted, twitwitted foolishness of priests!

The pseudo—wise, however, all the priests, the world weary and who—
ever's souls are of the woman's and servant's kind — oh how their game

And precisely that was supposed to be virtue and be called virtue, that
they played evil tricks on selﬁshness! And “selﬂess” — that is how they
wished themselves, with good reason, all these world—weary cowards and
cross spiders!

But for all of them now the day is coming, the transformation, the
judgement sword, the great uoou: then much shall be revealed!

And whoever pronounces the ego hale and holy and selﬁshness blessed,
indeed, he tells what he knows, this foreteller: “Loole, it is coming, it is hear,
the great hooh!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh the Spirit ofGravity

My mouth — is of the people: I speak too crudely and sincerely for Angora
rabbits. And my words sound even stranger to all cephalopods and pen
pushers.

My hand — is a fool's hand: watch out, all tables and walls, and whatever
else has space for foolish trim and foolish whim!

My foot — is a cloven foot; with it I clip—clop and trot over sticks and
stones, crissing and crossing the countryside, and devilish fun is my fast
run.

My stomach — it must be the stomach of an eagle? Because what it loves
best is ﬂesh of lamb. Certain at least, it is the stomach of a bird.

Nourished by innocent things and by a little, ready and impatient to
ﬂy, to ﬂy away — that is just my way: why should there not be something
of the bird's way in this!

And especially since I am the enemy of the spirit of gravity, that is
the bird's way; and truly, deadly enemy, arch—enemy, ancient enemy! Oh
where has my enmity not already ﬂown and ﬂown astray!

Of that I could even sing a song — and I want to sing it; even though I
am alone in my empty house and have to sing it to my own ears.

There are other singers, to be sure, for whom only for a full house
softens the vocal chords, makes the hands eloquent, the eyes expressive,
the heart alert — I am not like those.

Whoever one day teaches humans to ﬂy, will have shifted all boundary
stones; for him all boundary stones themselves will ﬂy into the air, he will
Christen the earth anew — as “the light one.”

The ostrich runs faster than the fastest horse, but it also sticks its head
heavily into the heavy earth; so too the human being who cannot yet ﬂy.

Heavy do earth and life seem to him; and the spirit of gravity wants
it so! But whoever wants to become light and a bird must love himself —
thus I teach.

Not, to be sure, with the love of the sick and addicted, because among
them even self—love stinks!

One has to learn to love oneself— thus I teach — with a hale and healthy
love, so that one can stand oneself and not have to roam around.

Such roaming around christens itself “love of the neighbor”: these
words so far have produced the best lying and hypocrisy, and especially
from those whom all the world found heavy.

And truly, this is not a command for today and tomorrow, this learning
to love oneself. Instead, of all arts this is the most subtle, cunning, ultimate
and most patient.

For one's own, you see, all one's own is well hidden; and of all buried
treasures, one's own is the latest to be dug up — this is the spirit of gravity's
doing.

Almost from the cradle, grave words and values are imparted to us;
“good” and “evil” this dowry calls itself. For its sake we are forgiven for
being alive.

And for this reason one lets the little children come to one, in order to
restrain them early on from loving themselves: this is the spirit of gravity's
doing.

And we — we faithfully lug what is imparted to us on hard shoulders
and over rough mountains! And if we sweat, then we are told: “Yes, life
is a heavy burden!”

But only the human being is a heavy burden to himself! This is because
he lugs too much that is foreign to him. Like a camel he kneels down and
allows himself to be well burdened.

Especially the strong human being who is eager to bear and inherently
reverent: too manyforeigh words and values he loads upon himself— now
life seems a desert to him!

154

Thirol Part



And true enough, much that is one's own is also a heavy burden! And
much of what people are on the inside is like an oyster, namely disgusting
and slimy and hard to grasp —

— so that a noble shell with noble ornamentation must intercede for it.
But one must also learn this art: to have a shell and seemly sight and clever
blindness!

Once more what is deceiving about people is that many a shell is meager
and sad and too much a shell. Much hidden goodness and strength is never
guessed; the most exquisite delicacies ﬁnd no tasters!

Women know this, the most exquisite ones: a bit fatter, a bit thinner —
oh how much destiny lies in so little!

The human being is hard to discover and hardest still for himself; often
the spirit lies about the soul. This is the spirit of gravity's doing.

But he will have discovered himself who speaks: “This is my good and
evil.” With this he has silenced the mole and dwarf who says: “Good for
all, evil for all.”

Indeed, nor do I like those for whom each thing is good and this world
seems the very best. Such types I call the all—complacent.

All—complacency that knows how to taste everything — that is not the
best taste! I honor the obstinate, choosy tongues and stomachs, which
have learned to say “I” and “Yes” and “No.”

But chewing and digesting everything — that is truly the swine's style!
To always say hee—yaw — only the ass learned that, and whoever is of its
spirit! —

Deep yellow and hot red: this is what my taste wants — it mixes blood into
all colors. But whoever whitewashes his house betrays to me a whitewashed
soul.

One is in love with mummies, the other with ghosts; and both alike
hostile to all ﬂesh and blood — oh how they both offend my taste! For I
love blood.

And I do not want to dwell and dawdle where everyone spits and spews:
that is just my taste — I would rather live among thieves and perjurers. No
one carries gold in their mouth.

But even more repugnant to me are all lick spittles; and the most
revolting animal of a human being that I found I christened “parasite”: it
did not want to love and yet wanted to live offlove.

Damned I call all those who have only one choice: to become evil beasts
or evil beast tamers: I would not build my hut among them.

155

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Damned I also call those who must always wait — they offend my taste:
all the publicans and grocers and kings and other shop— and country—
keepers.

Indeed, I too learned to wait, and thoroughly — but only to wait for
myself. And above all I learned to stand and walk and run and leap and
climb and dance.

But this is my teaching; whoever wants to ﬂy someday must ﬁrst learn
to stand and walk and run and climb and dance — one cannot ﬂy one's way
to ﬂight!

On rope ladders I learned to climb to many a window, with agile legs I
climbed up high masts: to sit atop tall masts of knowledge struck me as
no small bliss —

— to ﬂicker like small ﬂames atop tall masts; a small light, to
be sure, and yet a great comfort for stranded sailors and shipwreck
survivors!

By many a trail and manner I came to my truth; not on one ladder did
I climb to my height, where my eye roams out into my distance.

And I never liked asking the way — that always offended my taste! I
preferred to question and try the ways myself.

All my coming and going was a trying and questioning — and truly, one
must also learn to answer such questioning! That, however — is my taste:

— not good, not bad, but my taste, of which I am no longer shameful
nor secretive.

“This — it turns out — is my way — where is yours?” — That is how I ans—
wered those who asked me “the way.” The way after all — it does not exist!

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Oh 01a and New Tahlets

Here I sit and wait, old broken tablets around me and also new tablets
only partially written upon. When will my hour come?

— the hour of my going down, going under: for I want to return to
mankind once more.

This is what I wait for now; signs must come to me ﬁrst that it is my
hour — namely the laughing lion with a swarm of doves.

156

Thirol Part



Meanwhile I talk to myself as one who has time. No one tells me
anything new, and so I tell myself to myself.

2

When I came to mankind, I found them sitting on an old conceit: they
all conceited to have known for a long time what is good and evil for
humanity.

To them all talk of virtue seemed an old worn out thing; and whoever
wanted to sleep well even spoke about “good” and “evil” before going to
bed.

I disturbed this sleepiness when I taught: what is good and evil no one
lehowsyet — except for the creator!

He, however, is the one who creates a goal for mankind and gives the
earth its meaning and its future: This one ﬁrst erea tes the possibility that
something can be good and evil.

I told them to overthrow their old professorial chairs wherever that old
conceit had sat; I told them to laugh at their great masters of virtue and
their saints and poets and world redeemers.

I told them to laugh at their gloomy wise men and at any who ever
perched in warning, like black scarecrows, in the tree of life.

I sat down alongside their great road of graves and even among carrion
and vultures — and I laughed at all their yesteryear and its rotting, decaying
glory.

Indeed, like preachers of repentance and fools I screamed bloody mur—
der about all their great and small — that their best is so very small! that
their most evil is so very small! — I had to laugh.

Thus my wild longing cried and laughed out of me, born in the moun—
tains, a wild wisdom surely! — my great, winging, roaring longing.

And often it swept me off my feet and up and away, in the midst
of my laughter, where I ﬂew quivering, an arrow, through sun—drunken
delight:

— offinto distant futures not yet glimpsed in dreams, into hotter souths
than any artist ever dreamed of; there, where dancing gods are ashamed
of all clothing:

— so that I must speak in parables and limp and stutter like the poets;
and truly, I am ashamed that I must still be a poet! —

I57

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Where all becoming seemed to me the dance of gods and the mischief
of gods, and the world seemed unloosed and frolicsome and as though it
were ﬂeeing back to itself:

— as an eternal ﬂeeing from and seeking each other again of many gods,
as the blissful contradicting, again—hearing, again—nearing each other of
many gods:

Where all time seemed to me a blissful mockery of moments, where
necessity was freedom itself, which played blissfully with the sting of
freedom:

Where I once again found my old devil and arch—enemy, the spirit
of gravity, and everything he created: compulsion, statute, necessity and
consequence and purpose and will and good and evil:

For must there not exist something over which one dances, dances
away? Must not, for the sake of the light and the lightest — moles and
heavy dwarves exist? —

3

It was there too that I picked up the word “overman” along the way, and
that the human is something that must be overcome,

— that human being is a bridge and not an end; counting itself blessed
for its noon and evening as the way to new dawns:

— the Zarathustra—words about the great noon, and whatever else I
suspended above mankind like purple second sunsets.

Truly, I allowed them to see new stars together with new nights; and
over clouds and day and night I even spread laughter like a colorful
tent.

I taught them all my creating and striving: to carry together into one
what is fragment in mankind and riddle and horrid accident —

— as poet, riddle guesser and redeemer of chance I taught them to work
on the future, and to creatively redeem everything that was.

To redeem what is past in mankind and to recreate all “It was” until
the will speaks: “But I wanted it so! I shall want it so 7”

This I told them was redemption, this alone I taught them to call
redemption. —

Now I wait for my redemption — so that I can go to them for the last
time.

158

Thirol Part



And I want to go to mankind one more time: among them I want to go
under, dying I want to give them my richest gift!

I learned this from the sun when it goes down, the super—rich one: it
pours gold into the sea from its inexhaustible wealth —

— such that even the poorest ﬁsherman rows with gololeu oars! Because
I saw this once and did not tire of my tears as I gazed on. —

Zarathustra too wants to go under like the sun; now he sits and waits,
old broken tablets around him and also new tablets — partially written
upon.

4

Look here, here is a new tablet, but where are my brothers to help me
carry it to the valley and into hearts of ﬂesh?

This is what my great love of the farthest demands: do not spare your
heighhor! Human being is something that must be overcome.

There are manifold ways and means of overcoming: you see to it! But
only a jester thinks: “human being can also be leaped over.”

Overcome yourself even in your neighbor; and you should not let any—
one give you a right that you can rob for yourself!

What you do no one can do to you in turn. Observe, there is no retri—
bution.

Whoever cannot command himself should obey. And though many a
person can command himself, much is still missing before he also obeys
himself!

5

This is how souls of the noble kind would have it: they want nothing for
free, and life least of all.

Whoever is of the rabble wants to live for free; we others, however,
to whom life gave itself — we always reﬂect on what we can best give in
exchange!

And truly, it is a noble phrase that says: “what life promises us, we want
to keep — for life!”

One should not want to enjoy where one gives nothing to enjoy. And,
one should not want to enjoy!

Enjoyment and innocence, you see, are the most bashful things: both
do not want to be sought. One should have them — but one should sooner
seele guilt and suffering! —

hide is mere lambskin — how could we not tempt old idol priests!

Even in ourselves he still lives, the old idol priest, who roasts up
our best for his banquet. Oh my brothers, how could ﬁrstborn not be
sacriﬁces!

But our kind wants it so; and I love those who do not want to preserve
themselves. Those who are going under I love with my whole love: because
they are going over. —

To be true — this few can do! And whoever can, does not yet want to! But
least of all the good can do it.

Oh these good! — Goodpeople never speale the truth; for the spirit, being
good in this manner is a disease.

They give way, these good, they give themselves up, their heart repeats
words, their ground obeys; but whoever obeys, he tloes not hear himself!

Everything that the good call evil must come together, in order to give
birth to one truth; oh my brothers, are you also evil enough for this truth?

Audacious daring, long mistrust, the cruel no, surfeit, the cutting into
what is alive — how rarely this comes together! But from such semen —
truth is begotten!

Instead, even the dummies contradict him. “What?” say the dummies,
“everything is supposed to be in ﬂux? But the timbers and the railings are

Over the river everything is ﬁrm, all the values of things, the bridges,
concepts, all ‘good' and ‘eVil' — all of this is ﬁrm!” —

But when the hard winter comes, the beast tamer of rivers, then even the
wittiest learn to mistrust, and, sure enough, then not only the dummies
say: “Should everything not — stand still?”

“Basically everything stands still” — that is a real winter doctrine, a
good thing for sterile times, a good comfort for hibernators and stove
huggers.

“Basically everything stands still” — but against this preaches the thaw
wind!

The thaw wind, a bull that is no plowing bull — a raging bull, a destroyer
that breaks ice with its wrathful horns! But ice — hrealesfoothriages!

Yes my brothers, is everything not how in ﬂux? Have all railings and
footbridges not fallen into the water? Who could still hang on to “good”
and “evil”?

“Woe to us! Hail to us! The thaw wind is blowing!” — Preach me this,
oh my brothers, in all the streets!

There is an old delusion called good and evil. So far the wheel of this
delusion has revolved around soothsayers and astrologers.

Once people helieveol in soothsayers and astrologers, and therefore they
believed “Everything is fate: you should, because you must!”

Then later people mistrusted all soothsayers and astrologers, and there—
fore they believed “Everything is freedom: you can, because you want
to!”

Yes, my brothers, so far we have merely deluded ourselves, but not
known about the stars and the future, and therefore we have merely deluded
ourselves, but not known about good and evil!

and killers than such holy words?

Is there not in all life itself — robbing and killing? And for such words

This is my pity for everything past, that I see it is abandoned —

— abandoned to the favor, the spirit, the madness of each generation
that comes along, and interprets everything that was as the bridge to
itself!

A great despot could come along, a shrewd monster, who with his favor
and disfavor could force and forge the whole past, until it became a bridge
to him, and omen and herald and harbinger.

But this is the other danger and my other pity: whoever is of the rabble,
their remembrance goes no further back than their grandfather — and
with their grandfather time ends.

Thus all the past is abandoned; because it could happen one day that
the rabble would become ruler and in its shallow water all time would
drown.

Therefore, my brothers, we need a new uohility, which is the adversary
of all rabble and all despotic rule and which writes anew the word “noble”
on new tablets.

Many noble ones are needed, to be sure, and many kinds of noble ones
for hohility to exist! Or, as I once spoke in parables: “Precisely that is
godliness, that there are gods but no God!”

Oh my brothers, I consecrate and conduct you to a new nobility: you shall

Not where you come from shall constitute your honor from now

anymore! Or that you became a bulwark for what stands, to make it to

there is nothing to praise about that land!

You should love your ehilolreu 's lahol; let this love be your new nobility —

“Why live? All is vain! Life — that is threshing straw; life — that is burning

Such archaic babble still passes for “wisdom”; but it is honored more
highly heeause it smells old and musty. Even mustiness ennobles.

Children might speak like this: they fear ﬁre because it burned them!
There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.

And whoever is always “threshing straw,” why should he be allowed to
revile threshing? One really should muzzle such oxen!

Because they are all unclean in spirit, especially those who have neither
rest nor respite, unless they see the world from the hihter siole — these

To their faces I say, even if it does not sound kind: the world resembles
a human being in that it has a behind — that much is true!

There is much ﬁlth in the world: that much is true! But the world itself
is not therefore a ﬁlthy monster!

There is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smells foul: nausea
itself creates wings and water—divining powers!

Even in the best there is something that nauseates; and the best is still
something that must be overcome!

Yes my brothers, there is much wisdom in the fact that there is much
ﬁlth in the world! —

“Whoever learns much, he forgets all vehement desire” — today this is
whispered throughout all dark lanes.

“Wisdom makes weary, nothing is worth it; thou shalt not desire!” —
this new tablet I found hanging even in the open markets.

Break, my brothers, break me this new tablet too! The world—weary
hung it there and the preachers of death, and the jailers as well; just look,
it too is a sermon for slavery!

The reason they have such ruined stomachs is because they learned
badly and not what was best, and everything too early and everything too
fast; and they ate badly —

— you see, their spirit is a ruined stomach: it recommends death! Because
truly, my brothers, the spirit is a stomach!

Life is a well of joy; but for those out of whom the ruined stomach
speaks, the father of gloom, all wells are poisoned.

Knowing: that is joy to the lion—willed! But whoever has grown weary
is himself merely being “willed,” and all waves toss him around.

And so it always is with weak willed persons; they lose themselves along
the way. And ﬁnally their own weariness asks: “Why did we ever embark
on ways! It's all the same!”

To their ears it is music when they hear preached: “Nothing is worth
it! You shall not will!” But this is a sermon for slavery.

Yes my brothers, as a fresh roaring wind Zarathustra comes to all who
are weary of their way; many noses he will yet make sneeze!

My free breath also blows through walls, and down into prisons and
imprisoned spirits!

Willing liberates because willing is creating: thus I teach. And you

And even this learning you shall ﬁrst learn from me, namely learning—

World—weary! And you have not even become earth—alienated yet! I

weariness!

Not for nothing does your lip hang — a little earthly wish still sits on
it! And in your eye — doesn't a little cloud of unforgotten earthly joy ﬂoat
there?

There are many good inventions on earth, some useful, others pleasant,
for whose sake the earth is lovable.

And some of what is there has been invented so well that it is like a
woman's breasts: useful and pleasant at the same time.

But you world—weary! You earth—lazy! You should be ﬂogged with
switches! With ﬂoggings you should be made to step lively again.

After all, if you are not misﬁts and moribund wretches of whom the
earth is weary, then you are sly sloths or nibbling, creeping pleasure cats.
And if you do not want to run again with gusto, then you should — pass
away!

One should not try to be a physician for the incurable: thus Zarathustra
teaches — and so you should pass away!

But it takes more courage to make an end than to make a new verse: that
all physicians and poets know.

Oh my brothers, there are tablets created by weariness, and tablets created
by rotten laziness; even though they talk the same, still they want to be

Out of weariness he yawns at the road and the earth and the goal and

Now the sun burns on him and the dogs lick at his sweat; but he lies
there in his deﬁance and would rather die of thirst —

— die of thirst one span away from his goal! Truly, you will yet have to
drag him to his heaven by the hair — this hero!

Better still, just let him lie where he has laid himself so that sleep can
come to him, the comforter, with its cooling rushing rain:

I draw circles around me and sacred borders; ever fewer climb with me

But wherever you may climb with me, my brothers, see to it that a

Parasite: that is a worm, a crawling writhing worm that wants to glut
itself on your infected nicks and niches.

And its art consists in guessing where climbing souls are weary; in
your grief and dismay, in your tender modesty it builds its disgusting
nest.

Where the strong is weak, the noble one all too mild — in that place it
builds its disgusting nest; the parasite lives where the great person has
little nicks and niches.

What is the highest species of all being and what is the least? The para—
site is the least of species, but whoever is of the highest species nourishes
the most parasites.

After all, the soul that has the longest ladder and reaches down farthest
— how could it not have the most parasites clinging to it?

The most encompassing soul, which can run and stray and roam far—
thest within itself; the most necessary soul, which out of joy plunges itself
into chance —

— the soul that loves being, but submerges into becoming; the having
soul that wants to rise to willing and desiring —

— the soul that ﬂees itself and catches up to itself in the widest circle;
the wisest soul which folly persuades most sweetly —

— the one that loves itself most, in which all things have their current
and recurrent and ebb and ﬂow — indeed, how could the highest soul not
have the worst parasites?

Oh my brothers, am I perhaps cruel? But I say: if something is falling,
one should also give it a push!

Everything of today — it is falling, it is failing: who would want to stop
it! But I — I want to push it too!

Do you know the kind of lust that rolls stones down into steep depths?
— These people of today; just look at how they roll into my depths!

I am a prelude of better players, my brothers! An exemplary play! Aet
according to my example!

And whomever you cannot teach to ﬂy, him you should teach — to fall
faster!

21

I love the valiant, but it is not enough to be a ﬁerce combatant — one must
also know whom to combat!

And often there is more valiance in someone controlling himself and
passing by, so that he saves himself for the worthier enemy!

You should have only those enemies whom you hate, but not enemies
to despise; you must be proud of your enemy: this I taught you already
once before.

For the worthier enemy, my friends, you should save yourselves, and
therefore you must pass by much —

— especially pass by much rabble that thunders in your ears about folk
and peoples.

Keep your eye clear of their pros and cons! There is much justice, much
injustice here; whoever watches becomes angry.

Look around, beat them down — it's all the same here; therefore go
away into the woods and lay your swords to sleep!

Go your ways! And let folk and peoples go theirs! — dark ways, to be
sure, on which not a single hope ﬂashes anymore!

Let the shopkeeper rule where all that is left to glitter — is shopkeepers'
gold! The time of kings is no more; what calls itself a people today deserves
no kings.

Just look at how these peoples themselves do the same as the shop—
keepers; they pluck themselves the tiniest advantage from any
dustpan!

They lie in wait for one another, they look in hate at one another — this
they call “good neighbors.” Oh happy distant time when a people said to
themselves: “I want to be ruler over peoples!”

For the best should rule, my brothers, and the best also want to rule!
And wherever the teaching says differently, there — the best are missing.

If they had bread for free, oh no! What would they clamor for! Their
sustainment — that is their real entertainment, and they should have it
hard!

They are beasts of prey: in their “working” — preying is there too; in
their “earning” — outwitting is there too! Therefore they should have it
hard!

They should become better beasts of prey, more subtle, more clever,
more humau—lilee: the human being, after all, is the best beast of prey.

Human beings have already successfully preyed upon the virtues of all
animals; this is because human beings have had the hardest time of all
animals.

Only the birds are above him. And if human beings were to learn even
to ﬂy, watch out! How high — would his lust to prey ﬂy!

This is how I want man and woman: ﬁt for war the one, ﬁt for bearing
children the other, but both ﬁt to dance in head and limb.

And let each day be a loss to us on which we did not dance once! And
let each truth be false to us which was not greeted by one laugh!

In taking your wedding vows — see to it that you are not making your
heading vows. Vowing too quickly results in — breaking vows! And better
vow breaking than vow bending and vow pretending! A woman once said
to me: “Sure, I broke my wedding vows, but ﬁrst my wedding vows broke —
me!”

The worst of the vengefulI always found to be the mismatched couples:
they take it out on the whole world that they are no longer singles.

This is why I want honest people to speak honestly to one another:
“We love each other; let us see to it that we keep loving each other! Or did
we promise by mistake?”

— “Give us a trial period and a small marriage, so that we can see
whether we are ﬁt for a big marriage! It is a big thing to always be in
twos!”

Thus I counsel all honest people; and what then would my love for the
overman be, and for everything else that is to come, if I counseled and
conveyed otherwise!

Not merely to reproduce, but instead to surproduce — to that goal, my
brothers, may the garden of marriage help you!

Whoever has become wise about ancient origins will surely, in the end,
seek new wells of the future and new origins.

Yes my brothers, it will not be overly long and new peoples will originate
and new wells will roar down into new depths.

An earthquake, after all — it buries many wells, it causes much dying of
thirst: it also brings to light inner powers and secrets.

An earthquake reveals new wells. In an earthquake of ancient peoples
new wells break out.

And whoever cries out there: “Look, here is a fountain for many who
thirst, a heart for many who long, a will for many tools” — around him
gathers a people, that is: many who try.

Who can command, who must obey — here it is trieol! Indeed, with what
long searching and guessing and lack of success and learning and trying
again!

Human society: it is an experiment, this I teach — a long search: but it
searches for the commander! —

— an experiment, oh my brothers! And not a “contract!” Break, break
me such words of the soft hearted and half—and—halfs!

My brothers! In whom does the greatest danger lie for all of future
humanity? Is it not in the good and the just?

170

Thirol Part



— is it not in those who speak and feel in their hearts: “We already know
what is good and just, and we have it too; woe to any who still search
here!”

And whatever harm the evil may do, the harm of the good is the most
harmful harm!

And whatever harm the world slanderers may do, the harm of the good
is the most harmful harm!

My brothers, there was a man who once looked into the hearts of the
good and the just, and he spoke: “They are pharisees.” But he was not
understood.

The good and the just themselves were not permitted to understand
him: their spirit is imprisoned in their good conscience. The stupidity of
the good is unfathomably clever.

But this is the truth: the good must be pharisees — they have no choice!

The good must crucify the one who invents his own virtue! This is the
truth!

The second one, however, who discovered their land, the land, hearts
and soil of the good and just: he was the one who asked: “Whom do they
hate the most?”

The creator they hate the most; he who breaks tablets and old values,
the breaker — him they call the lawbreaker.

Because the good, you see — they can not create: they are always the
beginning of the end —

— they crucify the one who writes new values on new tablets,
they sacriﬁce the future to themselves — they crucify all future huma—
nity!

The good — they were always the beginning of the end. —

27

Oh my brothers, have you even understood these words? And what I once
said about the “last human being?” —

In whom does the greatest danger lie for all of future humanity? Is it
not in the good and the just?

You ﬂee from me? You are frightened? You tremble before these words?

My brothers, when I told you to break the good and the tablets of
the good, then for the ﬁrst time I launched mankind onto their high
seas.

And only now the great fright comes to them, the great looking—around
oneself, the great sickness, the great nausea, the great seasickness.

False coasts and false securities were taught you by the good; in the lies
of the good you were born and bielded. Everything has been duplicitous
and twisted from the ground up by the good.

But whoever discovered the land “human being” also discovered the
land “human future.” Now you will be seafarers, brave and patient!

Walk upright for once, my brothers, learn to walk upright! The sea is
stormy: Many want to right themselves again on you.

The sea is stormy: Everything is in the sea. Well then! Well now! You
old salts!

What fatherland! There our helm wants to steer, where our ehiltlreh's

“Why so hard!” — the kitchen coal once said to the diamond. “Are we not
close relatives?”

Why so soft? Oh my brothers, this I ask you: for are you not — my
brothers?

Why so soft, so retiring and yielding? Why is there so much denying
and denial in your hearts? And so little destiny in your gazes?

And if you do not want to be destinies and inexorable, how could you
triumph with me?

And if your hardness does not want to ﬂash and undo and cut through,
how could you one day create with me?

The creators are hard after all. And it must seem like bliss to you to
press your hand upon millennia as if upon wax —

— bliss to write upon the will of millennia as if upon bronze — harder
than bronze, more noble than bronze. Only the most noble is perfectly
hard.

This new tablet, my brothers, I place above you: heeome hard! —

Oh will, turning point of all need, you my point of necessity! Save me

The Convalescent
1

One morning not long after his return to his cave, Zarathustra sprang from
his bed like a madman, screamed with a terrifying voice and behaved as
though someone else were lying on his bed, who did not want to get up.
And Zarathustra's voice reverberated so much that his animals rushed
to him frightened, and from every cave and hiding place neighboring
on Zarathustra's cave, all the animals scurried away — ﬂying, ﬂuttering,
crawling, leaping in whatever manner of foot or feather they were given.
But Zarathustra said these words:

Up, abysmal thought, out of my depths! I am your rooster and dawn,
you sleepy worm: up! Up! My voice will yet crow you awake!

I73

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Unsnap the straps of your ears: listen! Because I want to hear you!
Up! Up! Here there is thunder enough to make even graves learn to
listen!

And wipe the sleep and all that befogs and blinds you from your eyes!
Hear me with your eyes too: my voice is a remedy even for those born
blind.

And once you are awake, you shall remain awake eternally. It is not my
manner to wake great—grandmothers from their sleep only to tell them —
go back to sleep!

You stir, you stretch, you gasp? Up! Up! No gasping — you will speak
to me! Zarathustra summons you, the godless one!

I, Zarathustra, the advocate of life, the advocate of suffering, the advo—
cate of the circle — you I summon, my most abysmal thought!

Hail to me! You are coming — I hear you! My abyss speales, I have
unfolded my ultimate depth to the light!

Hail to me! Here now! Give me your hand — ha! Let go! Haha! — Nausea,
nausea, nausea — oh no!

Scarcely had he spoken these words, however, when Zarathustra collapsed
like a dead man and long remained as if dead. But when he came to he
was pale and he trembled, still lying down, and for a long time he wanted
neither to eat nor drink. This behavior lasted seven days; meanwhile, his
animals did not leave his side day and night, unless the eagle ﬂew out to
fetch food. And whatever prey it fetched together it laid on Zarathustra's
bed until eventually Zarathustra lay among yellow and red berries, grapes,
red apples, aromatic herbs and pine cones. At his feet, however, two lambs
were spread out, which the eagle with difﬁculty had taken as prey from
their shepherds.

Finally, after seven days, Zarathustra sat up on his bed, picked up one
of the red apples, smelled it, and found its aroma lovely. Then his animals
believed the time had come to speak with him.

“Oh Zarathustra,” they said. “Now you have been lying like this for
seven days, with heavy eyes: do you not want at last to get on your feet?

Step out of your cave: the world awaits you like a garden. The wind is
playing with heady fragrances that make their way to you; and all brooks
want to run after you.

174

Thirol Part



All things long for you, while you have stayed alone for seven days —
step out of your cave! All things want to be your physician!

Did perhaps some new knowledge come to you, something sour, heavy?
You lay there like leavened dough, your soul rose up and swelled over all
its rims. 7”

— “Oh my animals,” answered Zarathustra. “Just keep babbling and let
me listen! It invigorates me so when you babble: where there is babbling
the world indeed lies before me like a garden.

How lovely it is that there are words and sounds; aren't words and
sounds rainbows and illusory bridges between things eternally separated?

To each soul belongs another world; for each soul every other soul is a
hinterworld.

Illusion tells its loveliest lies about the things that are most similar,
because the tiniest gap is hardest to bridge.

For me — how would there be something outside me? There is
no outside! But we forget this with all sounds; how lovely it is that we
forget!

Have names and sounds not been bestowed on things so that human
beings can invigorate themselves on things? It is a beautiful folly, speaking:
with it humans dance over all things.

How lovely is all talking and all lying of sounds! With sounds our love
dances on colorful rainbows.” —

— “Oh Zarathustra,” said the animals then. “To those who think as we
do, all things themselves approach dancing; they come and reach out their
hands and laugh and retreat — and come back.

Everything goes, everything comes back; the wheel of being rolls eter—
nally. Everything dies, everything blossoms again, the year of being runs
eternally.

Everything breaks, everything is joined anew; the same house of being
builds itselfeternally. Everything parts, everything greets itselfagain; the
ring of being remains loyal to itself eternally.

In every Instant being begins; around every Here rolls the ball There.
The middle is everywhere. Crooked is the path of eternity.” —

— “Oh you foolish rascals and barrel organs!” answered Zarathustra,
smiling again. “How well you know what had to come true in seven
days —

— and how that monster crawled into my throat and choked me! But I
bit off its head and spat it away from me.

175

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And you — you have already made a hurdy—gurdy song of it? Now I lie
here, weary still from this biting and spitting out, sick still from my own
redemption.

Amlyou looked on at all ofthis? Oh my animals, are you also cruel? Did
you want to watch my great pain the way people do? For human beings
are the cruelest animal.

Tragic plays, bullﬁghts and cruciﬁxions have always made them feel
best on earth; and when they invented hell for themselves, see here — it
was their heaven on earth.

When a great human being cries out — in a ﬂash the little ones come
running, and their tongues hang out with lasciviousness. But they call it
their ‘pity.'

The little human being, especially the poet — how eagerly he puts his
accusations against life into words! Hear him, but do not fail to hear the
lust that is in all his accusing!

Such accusers of life are overcome by life in a blink of an eye. ‘You love
me?' says the ﬂirt. ‘Wait just a while longer, I don't have time for you yet.'

The human being is the cruelest animal against itself; and with all those
who call themselves ‘sinner' and ‘cross bearer' and ‘penitent,' do not fail
to hear the lust in such complaining and accusing!

And I myself— do I want therefore to be the accuser of mankind? Oh
my animals, this alone have I learned so far, that for mankind their most
evil is necessary for their best —

— that whatever is most evil is their best power and the hardest stone
for the highest creator; and that mankind must become better auol more
evil —

The cross on which I suffered was not that I know human beings are
evil — instead, I cried as no one yet has cried:

‘A shame that their most evil is so very small! A shame that their best
is so very small!'

My great surfeit of human beings — that choked me and crawled into
my throat; and what the soothsayer said: ‘All is the same, nothing is worth
it, knowledge chokes.'

A long twilight limped ahead of me, a tired to death and drunk to death
sadness that spoke with a yawning mouth:

‘Eternally he returns, the human of whom you are weary, the small
human being' — thus my sadness yawned and dragged its foot and could
not fall asleep.

176

Thirol Part



For me the human earth transformed into a cave, its chest caved in;
everything living became human mold and bones and crumbling past.

My sighing sat upon all human graves and could no longer stand up;
my sighing and questioning croaked and choked and gnashed and lashed
day and night:

— ‘alas, human beings recur eternally! The small human beings recur
eternally!' —

Naked I once saw them both, the greatest human and the smallest
human: all too similar to one another — all too human still even the greatest
one!

All too small the greatest one! That was my surfeit of humans! And
eternal recurrence of even the smallest! — That was my surfeit of all
existence!

Oh nausea! Nausea! Nausea!” — Thus spoke Zarathustra and sighed
and shuddered, because he remembered his sickness. But his animals did
not allow him to continue.

“Speak no more, you convalescent!” — answered his animals. “Rather
go outside where the world awaits you like a garden.

Go outside to the roses and bees and swarms of doves! Especially to
the song birds, so that you can learn to sing from them!

Singing after all is for convalescents, let the healthy person talk. And
even if the healthy person also wants songs, he wants different songs than
the convalescent.”

— “Oh you foolish rascals and barrel organs, shut up!” — answered
Zarathustra, and he smiled at his animals. “How well you know which
comfort I invented for myself in seven days!

That I must sing once again — this comfort I invented for myself and
this convalescence; but do you want to make that into a hurdy—gurdy song
right away too?”

— “Speak no more,” answered his animals again. “Instead, you conva—
lescent, fashion yourself a lyre ﬁrst, a new lyre!

Behold oh Zarathustra! For your new songs new lyres are needed.

Sing and foam over, Zarathustra; heal your soul with new songs so
that you can bear your great destiny, which was never before a human's
destiny!

For your animals know well, oh Zarathustra, who you are and must
become; behold, you are the teacher of the eternal recurrence — that now is
your destiny!

I77

Thus S polee Zara thustra



That you must teach this teaching as the ﬁrst — how could this great
destiny not also be your greatest danger and sickness!

Behold, we know what you teach: that all things recur eternally and
we ourselves along with them, and that we have already been here times
eternal and all things along with us.

You teach that there is a great year of becoming, a monster of a great
year; like an hourglass it must turn itself over anew, again and again, so
that it runs down and runs out anew —

— so that all these years are the same as each other, in what is greatest
and also in what is smallest — so that we ourselves in every great year are
the same, in what is greatest and also in what is smallest.

And if you wanted to die now, oh Zarathustra: behold, we know too
how you would speak to yourself then: — but your animals beg you not to
die yet!

You would speak and without trembling, rather taking a deep breath,
blissfully; for a great weight and oppressiveness would be taken from you,
you most patient one!

‘Now I die and disappear,' you would say, ‘and in an instant I will be a
nothing. Souls are as mortal as bodies.

But the knot of causes in which I am entangled recurs — it will create
me again! I myself belong to the causes of the eternal recurrence.

I will return, with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this
snake — hot to a new life or a better life or a similar life:

— I will return to this same and selfsame life, in what is greatest as well
as in what is smallest, to once again teach the eternal recurrence of all
things —

— to once again speak the word about the great earth of noon and human
beings, to once again proclaim the overman to mankind.

I spoke my word, I break under my word: thus my eternal fate wills it
— as proclaimer I perish!

The hour has now come for the one who goes under to bless himself.
Thus — euols Zarathustra's going under!'” —

When the animals had spoken these words they fell silent and waited
for Zarathustra to say something to them: but Zarathustra did not hear
that they were silent. Instead he lay still, with eyes closed, like someone
sleeping — even though he was not sleeping. Indeed, at this moment he
was conversing with his soul. The snake and the eagle, however, ﬁnding

cautiously slipped away.

On Great Longing

Oh my soul, I taught you to say “today” and “once” and “formerly,” and
to dance your round over all here and then and there.

Oh my soul, I redeemed you from all nooks, I swept dust, spiders and
twilight off of you.

Oh my soul, I washed the petty bashfulness and the nook—Virtue from
you and persuaded you to stand naked before the eyes of the sun.

With the storm called “spirit” I blew over your choppy sea; I blew all
clouds away, I even choked the choker who is called “sin.”

Oh my soul, I gave you the right to say no like the storm and to say yes
as the open sky says yes: still as light you now stand and even if you pass
through storms of denial.

Oh my soul, I gave you back your freedom over what is cre—
ated and uncreated: and who knows as you know the lust of future
things?

Oh my soul, I taught you contempt that does not come like a gnawing
worm, the great, loving contempt that loves most where it has the most
contempt.

Oh my soul, I taught you to persuade such that you persuade even the
grounds; like the sun that persuades even the sea into its heights.

Oh my soul, I took from you all obeying, knee—bending and sir—saying;
I myself gave you the name “turning point of need” and “destiny.”

Oh my soul, I gave you new names and colorful playthings, I called you
“destiny” and “compass of compasses” and “umbilical cord of time” and
“azure bell.”

Oh my soul, to your soil I gave all wisdom to drink, all new wines and
also all old strong wines of wisdom from time immemorial.

Oh my soul, I poured every sun upon you and every night and every
silence and every longing — then you grew up for me like a grape—
Vine.

Oh my soul, super—rich and heavy you stand there now, a grapevine
with swelling udders and crowded, brownish gold grapes —

Oh my soul, nowhere now is there a soul that could be more loving
and more compassing and encompassing! Where would future and past
be closer together than in you?

Oh my soul, I gave you everything and all my hands have become empty
on you — and now! Now you say to me smiling and full of melancholy:
“Who of us is supposed to be thankful?

— does the giver not have to give thanks that the receiver received? Is
bestowing not a bare necessity? Is receiving not — mercy?”

Oh my soul, I understand the smiling of your melancholy: your super—
richness itself reaches out with longing hands!

Your fullness gazes out over roaring seas and searches and waits; the
longing of over—fullness gazes smilingly from your sky—like eyes!

And truly, oh my soul! Who could see your smile and not melt into
tears! The angels themselves melt into tears at the super—goodness of
your smile.

It is your goodness and super—goodness that do not want to lament and
weep; and yet, oh my soul, your smile longs for tears and your trembling
mouth for sobs.

“Is not all weeping a lamentation? And is not all lamentation an
accusation?” This is how you speak to yourself, and this is why, oh my
soul, you would rather smile than pour out your suffering —

— pour out your suffering in gushing tears over your fullness and over
all the aching of the grapevine for the Vintner and his knife!

But if you do not want to weep and weep out your purple melancholy,
then you must sing, oh my soul! — Look, I too smile for telling you this in
advance:

— sing with a roaring song until all seas become silent, to listen for your
longing —

— until the skiff ﬂoats over silent longing seas, the golden wonder around
whose gold all good and bad and wonderful things hop —

— even many great and small animals and everything that has light,
wondrous feet, and can run on paths of Violet blue —

— over to the golden wonder, the voluntary skiff and to its master: but
he is the Vintner who waits with his diamond knife —

— your great redeemer, oh my soul, the nameless one — for whom only
future songs will ﬁnd a name! And truly, your breath is fragrant already
with future songs! —

— already you glow and dream, already you drink thirstily at all deep,
resounding wells of comfort, already your melancholy rests in the bliss of

sing, indeed, that was my ultimate!

That I commanded you to sing — speak now, speak: who of us now must
be thankful? — Better yet: sing to me, sing oh my soul! And let me give
thanks! —

The Other Dame S orig

Into your eyes I looked recently, oh life: I saw gold gleaming in your night
eyes — my heart skipped a beat at this thrill:

— I saw a golden boat gleaming on nocturnal waters, a sinking, drinking,
winking golden rocking boat!

You cast a glance at my foot, at my dance—drunken foot; a laughing,
asking, melting rocking glance:

Two times only your little hands shook their maracas — and already my
dance—drunk foot began to rock. —

I kicked up my heels, my toes fairly strained to hear you disclose: after
all, a dancer has ears in his toes!

I leaped over to you; you dodged my advance, retreating deftly; and
only the licking, ﬂeeing, trailing tongues of your hair were left me!

I leaped away from your hair's lurid snaking; and there you stood, half
facing me, your eyes aﬁre with aching.

Your crooked gazes teach me — crooked running; on crooked paths my
foot learns — crooked cunning!

I fear you up close, and I love you away; your leaving spells me, your
seeking compels me — I suffer, but suffer gladly for you any day!

You whose coldness ignites, whose hate is alluring; whose ﬂeeing invites,
whose scorn is — stirring:

— who would not hate you, you great binder, and winder, temptress,
attemptress, and ﬁnder! Who would not love you, you innocent, ardent
one, wind—bride and child—eyed sinner!

Where are you pulling me now, you standout and upstart? And now
you ﬂee me again, sweet wildcat, thankless heart!

I dance after you, and follow your trail using any clue. Where are you?
Give me your hand! Even a ﬁnger will do!

Here are caves and thickets, we could get lost in there! — Stop! Stand
still! Do you not see owls and bats in the air?

You owls! You bats! This leaves you in stitches? Where are we? Such
howling and yelping you learned from the bitches.

You gnash at me sweetly with little white teeth; your curly little mane,
evil eyes peeking out from beneath!

This is a dance moving every which way; I am the hunter — are you my
hound or my prey?

Next to me now! And quick, you evil little jumper! Up now! And over!
— Oh no! I slipped and now I'm on my rump here!

Oh see me lying, miss mischief, have mercy on me! There are paths to
sweet places — where I would rather be!

— Paths of love through silent blooming plants! Or down there along
the lake, where goldﬁsh swim and dance!

Are you weary now? Over there are sheep and sunset—swoons; is it not
sweet to sleep when shepherds play their tunes?

Are you so bitter weary! I will carry you there, just relax and let your
arms sink! And if you thirst — I have something, but nothing you would
drink! —

— Oh this cursed clever, supple snake and slippery witch! Gone with—
out a trace? But left behind, and left by hand, I feel two red spots on my
face!

I am truly tired of always playing your sheepish shepherd pal! You
witch, if I have so far sung for you, now you for me will — yell!

To the beat of my whip you will dance so and yell so! But did I forget
the whip? — Oh no! —

Then life answered me like this and covered her dainty little ears:

“Oh Zarathustra! Please do not crack your whip so fearfully! Surely you
know: noise murders thoughts — and just now the most tender thoughts
are coming to me.

182

Thirol Part



We are both a couple of real do—no—goods and do—no—evils. Beyond
good and evil we found our island and our green meadow — we two alone!
Therefore we at least have to like each other!

And just because we do not love each other from the heart — must we
grudge one another for not loving each other from the heart?

That I like you, and often too much, this you know; and the reason is
that I am jealous of your wisdom. Ah, this crazy old fool of a wisdom!

If your wisdom ever ran away from you, oh! Then my love would also
quickly run away from you too.” —

Then life looked pensively behind her and around her and said softly:
“Oh Zarathustra, you are not faithful enough for me!

You do not love me nearly as much as you say; I know you are thinking
of leaving me soon.

There is an old heavy, heavy growling bell: it growls at night all the way
up to your cave —

— when you hear this bell toll the hour at midnight, then you think
between one and twelve about —

— you think, oh Zarathustra, I know it, about how you will soon leave
me!” —

“Yes,” I answered, hesitating. “But you also know 7” And I said some—
thing in her ear, right in it between her tangled yellow, foolish shaggy
locks.

“You lehow that, oh Zarathustra? No one knows that.” —

And we looked at each other and gazed at the green meadow, over
which the cool evening had just spread, and we wept together. — But at
that moment I loved life more than I ever loved all my wisdom. —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

If I ever sat jubilating where old gods lie buried, blessing the world,

Oh, where in the world has greater folly occurred than among the

of the pitying?

Woe to all lovers who do not yet have an elevation that is above
their pitying!

Thus the devil once spoke to me: “Even God has his hell: it is his
love for mankind.”

And recently I heard him say these words: “God is dead; God died
of pity for mankind.”

The Honey Sacriﬁce

— And again moons and years passed over Zarathustra's soul and he took
no notice of it; but his hair had turned white. One day as he sat on a
stone before his cave and gazed outward — there where one looks out
upon the sea and beyond twisting abysses — his animals walked around
him pensively until ﬁnally they stood before him.

“Oh Zarathustra,” they said. “Are you perhaps on the lookout for your
happiness?” — “What does happiness matter!” he answered. “I haven't
strived for happiness for a long time, I strive for my work.” — “Oh
Zarathustra,” said the animals again. “You say that as one who has had
overly much of the good. Do you not lie in a sky—blue lake of happiness?”
— “You foolish rascals,” answered Zarathustra, smiling. “How well you
chose your metaphor! But you also know that my happiness is heavy and
not like a ﬂuid wave of water; it presses me and will not leave me alone
and it acts like melted tar.” —

Then the animals again walked around him pensively and once more
they stood before him. “Oh Zarathustra,” they said, “is that why you
yourself are becoming ever yellower and darker, even though your hair
looks white and ﬂaxen? Don't you see, you are bogged down in your
misfortune!” — “What are you saying, my animals?” said Zarathustra, and
he laughed. “Truly, I smeared when I used the word tar. What's happening
to me is common to all fruits that ripen. It's the honey in my veins that
makes my blood thicker and also makes my soul calmer.” — “It will be
as you say, oh Zarathustra,” answered the animals, and they pressed up
against him. “But do you not want to climb a high mountain today? The
air is pure and today one sees more of the world than ever before.” — “Yes,
my animals,” he answered. “Your advice is superb and after my own heart:
I do want to climb a high mountain today! But see to it that there is honey
at hand for me there; yellow, white, good, icy fresh golden honey from the
comb. Because know this: I want to offer the honey sacriﬁce up there.” —

But when Zarathustra was up on the summit he sent home the animals
which had accompanied him, and he found that he was alone now — then
he laughed with his whole heart, looked around and spoke thus:

That I spoke of sacriﬁces and honey sacriﬁces was merely a sleight of
speech and, truly, a useful folly! Up here I may speak more freely than
before hermits' caves and hermits' pets.

191

Thus S polee Zara thustra



What sacriﬁce! I squander what was bestowed me, I the squanderer
with a thousand hands: How could I call that — sacriﬁcing!

And when I desired honey I merely desired bait and sweet ooze and
mucus, for which even growling bears and odd, surly, evil birds lick with
their tongues:

— the best bait, as it is needed by hunters and ﬁshermen. Because if the
world is like a dark jungle and a pleasure garden for all wild hunters, to
me it seems even more, and preferably, an abysmal rich sea,

— a sea full of colorful ﬁshes and crabs, for whose sake even gods would
crave to become ﬁshermen and net casters: so rich is the world in odd
things great and small!

Especially the human world, the human sea — toward it I now cast my
golden ﬁshing rod and say: open up, you human abyss!

Open up and toss me your ﬁshes and glittering crabs! With my best
bait today I bait the oddest human ﬁshes!

— my very happiness I cast far and wide, between sunrise, noon and
sunset, to see if many human ﬁshes learn to jiggle and wiggle on my
happiness.

Until, biting on my sharp hidden hooks, they have to emerge into my
height, the motliest gorge gudgeons to the most spiteful of all ﬁshers of
human ﬁsh.

That 's what I am, after all, at bottom and from the start; reeling, reeling
in, raising up, raising, a raiser, a cultivator and taskmaster who not for
nothing once told himself: “Become who you are!”

So now human beings may come up to me; you see, I am still waiting
for the sign that it is time for my descent; I myself will not go under yet,
as I must, and among human beings.

That's why I'm waiting here, cunning and mocking on high moun—
tains, not impatient, not patient, but instead one who has forgotten even
forbearance — because he no longer “bears.”

My destiny leaves me time for this: surely it has forgotten me? Or does
it sit behind a big rock in the shade, catching ﬂies?

And really, I like my eternal destiny for not rushing and pressing me
and for leaving me time for jests and spite, so that today I climbed this
high mountain to catch ﬁsh.

Did a human being ever catch ﬁsh on high mountains? And even if what
I want and do up here is folly, this is still better than becoming pompous
and green and gold down there from waiting —

192

Fourth auol Final Part



— a swaggering wrath snorter from waiting, a holy, howling mountain
storm, an impatient one who cries down into the valleys: “Hear me, or I
shall whip you with the lash of God!”

Not that I would grudge such angry men for it; they are good enough
for me to laugh at! They have to be impatient anyway, these big noisy
drums, who either get to speak today or never!

But I and my destiny — we do not speak to today, nor do we speak
to never: we have patience enough and time and overtime for speaking.
Because it must come someday and may not pass by.

What must come someday and may not pass by? Our great Hazar, that
is our great distant human empire, the Zarathustra empire of a thousand
years —

How distant might such a “distance” be? What do I care! But it is no
less ﬁrm to me on that account — with both feet I stand ﬁrmly on this
ground,

— on an eternal ground, on hard primeval rock, on this highest, hardest
primeval mountain chain, to which all winds come as if to a weathershed,
asking Where? and from Where? and Where to?

Laugh, laugh here my bright hearty spite! Throw down your glittering,
mocking laughter from high mountains! Bait me the most beautiful human
ﬁsh with your glittering!

And whatever in all the seas belongs to me, my actual me in all things
— ﬁsh that out for me, bring that up to me — that's what I am waiting for,
I the most spiteful of all ﬁshermen.

Out, out my ﬁshing rod! Into and down, bait of my happiness! Drip
your sweetest dew, my heart's honey! Bite, my ﬁshing rod, into the belly
of all black gloom!

Out there, out there my eye! Oh how many seas surround me, what
dawning human futures! And above me — what rosy red stillness! What
cloudless silence!

The Cry of Distress

The next day Zarathustra again sat on the stone before his cave, while
the animals roamed about in the world to bring home new nourishment
— and new honey too, because Zarathustra had spent and squandered the
old honey to the last drop. But as he sat there like this, with a stick in
his hand and tracing the outline of his shadow on the ground, reﬂecting

I93

Thus S polee Zara thustra



and, truly, not about himself and his shadow — then all at once he was
frightened and startled, because next to his own shadow he saw another
shadow. And as he quickly looked around and stood up, there was the
soothsayer standing next to him, the same one whom he had wined and
dined at his table, the proclaimer of the great weariness who taught: “All
is the same, nothing is worth it, the world is without meaning, knowl—
edge chokes.” But his face had transformed in the meantime; and when
Zarathustra looked him in the eyes, his heart was frightened again — so
many grave proclamations and ashen gray lightning bolts animated this
face.

The soothsayer, who read what was going on in Zarathustra's soul,
wiped his hand over his face as if he wanted to wipe it away; Zarathustra
did the same. And when both had silently composed and strengthened
themselves in this manner, they shook hands as a sign that they wanted
to recognize one another.

“Welcome,” said Zarathustra, “you soothsayer of the great weariness;
not for nothing were you once a guest at my table. Eat and drink with
me today too, and forgive that a contented old man joins you at the
table!” “A contented old man?” answered the soothsayer, shaking his head.
“Whoever you are or want to be, oh Zarathustra, you've been that long
enough up here — in a short time your skiff will no longer be on the
rocks!” — “Am I on the rocks then?” asked Zarathustra, laughing. — “The
waves around your mountain,” answered the soothsayer, “rise and rise;
the waves of great distress and gloom: soon they will lift your skiff as
well and carry you away.” — Zarathustra was silent on hearing this and
surprised. — “Do you not hear anything yet?” continued the soothsayer.
“Is there not a rushing and roaring up from the depths?” — Zarathustra
kept silent and listened; then he heard a long, long cry that the abysses
threw back and forth to each other, as if none wanted to keep it — so evil
did it sound.

“You wicked proclaimer,” spoke Zarathustra at last. “That's a cry of
distress and the cry of a human being, even if it comes out of a black sea.
But what is human distress to me! My ﬁnal sin, the one saved up for me
— do you know what it's called?”

— “Pity!” answered the soothsayer from his overﬂowing heart, and he
raised both hands high — “oh Zarathustra, I come to seduce you to your
last sin!” —

I94

Fourth auol Final Part



And scarcely had these words been spoken when the cry rang out
again, and longer and more anxious than before, also much closer now.
“Do you hear? Do you hear, oh Zarathustra?” cried the soothsayer. “The
cry is meant for you, it calls you: come, come, come, it is time, it is high
time!” —

Zarathustra was silent after this, confused and shaken; ﬁnally he
asked, like one who hesitates inwardly: “And who is it there that calls
me?”

“But you know it already,” answered the soothsayer vehemently. “Why
do you conceal yourself? It is the higher man who calls for you!”

“The higher man?” cried Zarathustra, seized by horror. “What does
he want? What does he want? The higher man! What does he want here?”
— And his skin was bathed in sweat.

But the soothsayer did not respond to Zarathustra's fear, and instead
he listened and listened toward the depths. But after it was quiet there for
a long time, he turned his glance back and saw Zarathustra standing and
trembling.

“Oh Zarathustra,” he began with a sad voice. “You do not stand there
like one whose happiness makes him giddy: you will have to dance to keep
from falling down!

But even if you were to dance before me and leap all your side—leaps, no
one should be allowed to tell me: ‘Look, here dances the last gay human
being!'

Anyone who came to this height looking for him would come in vain;
caves he would ﬁnd, to be sure, and hinter—caves, hiding places for hiders,
but no shafts of happiness and treasure chambers and new golden veins
of happiness.

Happiness — how could anyone ﬁnd happiness among those who are
buried away and hermits? Must I seek the last happiness far away on
blessed isles between forgotten seas?

But all is the same, nothing is worth it, searching does not help, and
there are no blessed isles anymore!” —

Thus sighed the soothsayer; but at his last sigh Zarathustra became
bright and certain once more, like someone who comes from a deep chasm
into the light. “No! No! No! Three times no!” he cried in a strong voice,
stroking his beard. “That I know better! There are still blessed isles! Be
silent ahout that, you sighing sadsack!

I9S

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Stop splashing ahout that, you rain cloud of the morning! Do I not
already stand here soaked by your gloom and drenched like a dog?

Now I'll shake myself and run away from you, so that I can dry off
again; that shouldn't surprise you! Do I seem discourteous to you? But
this is my court.

But as far as your higher man is concerned: let's go! I'll search for him
right now in those woods — from there his cry came. Perhaps he is beset by
some evil beast.

He is in my territory, and in here he shall not come to harm! And truly,
there are many evil beasts in my territory.” —

With these words Zarathustra turned to leave. Then the soothsayer
spoke: “Oh Zarathustra, you are a rogue!

I already know that you want to get rid of me! You would rather run
into the woods and pursue evil beasts!

But what will it help you? By evening you will have me again anyway,
I will be sitting in your own cave, patient and heavy like a block — and I
will be waiting for you!”

“So be it!” called Zarathustra over his shoulder as he departed. “And
whatever is mine in my cave, it belongs to you too, my guest!

But if you should ﬁnd honey in there, good! Then just lick it up, you
old growling bear, and sweeten your soul! Because by evening we will both
want to be in a good mood,

— in a good mood and glad that this day came to an end! And you
yourself will dance to my songs as my dancing bear.

You don't believe it? You shake your head? Well then! We'll see, old
bear! But I too am — a soothsayer.”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

Conversation with the Kings
1

Zarathustra had been underway in his mountains and woods for not even
one hour when all at once he saw a strange procession. On precisely the
path he wanted to take down, two kings came walking, adorned with
crowns and purple sashes and as colorful as ﬂamingoes; before them they
drove a burdened ass. “What do these kings want in my kingdom?” spoke
Zarathustra to his astonished heart, and he hid himself quickly behind a

196

Fourth auol Final Part



bush. But when the kings caught up to him he said, half out loud like a
person talking to himself: “Strange! Strange! What rhyme or reason can
this have? I see two kings — and only one ass!”

Then the two kings stopped, smiled, looked toward the place from
which the voice had come and then turned to face one another. “Such
things are also thought among us,” said the king to the right, “but one
does not speak it.”

But the king to the left shrugged his shoulders and answered: “It's
probably a goatherd. Or a hermit who has lived too long among cliffs and
trees. After all, no society at all also ruins good manners.”

“Good manners?” retorted the other king indignantly and bitterly.
“Then what are we trying to run away from? Is it not ‘good manners'? Is
it not our ‘good society?'

Better, truly, to live among hermits and goatherds than live with our
gilded, fake, make—up wearing rabble — even if it calls itself ‘good society,'

— even if it calls itself ‘nobility.' But there everything is fake and foul,
starting with the blood, thanks to old diseases and even worse healers.

Best and dearest to me today is still a healthy peasant, coarse, cunning,
stubborn, enduring: that is the most noble type today.

The peasant today is the best; and peasant—type should be ruler! But
it is the kingdom of the rabble — I will not be deceived anymore. Rabble
now, that means: mishmash.

Rabble mishmash: in it everything is jumbled together, saint and
scoundrel and Junker and Jew and every beast from the ark of Noah.

Good manners! Everything among us is fake and foul. No one knows
how to revere anymore — that precisely is what we are running away from.
They are mawkish, obtrusive dogs, they are gilders of palm leaves.

This nausea chokes me, that we kings ourselves became fake, decked
out and dressed up in old yellowed grandfathers' pomp, medals for the
most moronic and the slyest and whoever the hell haggles today for
power!

We are hot the ﬁrst — and yet we must siguiﬁ/ that we are: it is this
deception that we have ﬁnally had enough of, that nauseates us.

We got away from the riffraff, all these screamers and scribble—blowﬂies,
all the shopkeeper stench, all the twitching ambition, all the bad breath —
phooey to living among the riffraff,

— phooey to signifying the ﬁrst among the riffrafﬂ Oh nausea! Nausea!
Nausea! What do we kings matter anymore!” —

I97

Thus S polee Zara thustra



“Your old illness befalls you again,” said now the king on the left.
“Nausea befalls you, my poor brother. But you know too that someone is
listening to us.”

At once Zarathustra, whose ears and eyes had opened wide at this
conversation, rose from his hiding place, approached the kings and began:

“The one who listens to you, who listens gladly to you, you kings, is
called Zarathustra.

I am Zarathustra, who once spoke: ‘What do kings matter anymore!'
Forgive me, I was so pleased when you said to one another: ‘What do we
kings matter!'

But here is my realm and my rule: what might you be seeking now in
my realm? Or perhaps you have fouuol along the way what I am seeking,
namely the higher man.”

When the kings heard this they beat their breasts and exclaimed with
one voice: “We have been found out!

With the sword of your words you strike through our hearts' thickest
darkness. You discover our distress, for behold! We are on our way to ﬁnd
the higher man —

— the man who is higher than we, even though we are kings. To him
we lead this ass. The highest man, you see, should be the highest ruler on
earth.

There is no harder misfortune in all human destiny than when the
powerful of the earth are not also the ﬁrst human beings. Then everything
becomes fake and crooked and monstrous.

And should they even be last and more beast than human; then the
rabble rises and rises in price, until ﬁnally even rabble virtue speaks:
‘Behold, I alone am virtue!'” —

“What did I just hear?” answered Zarathustra. “What wisdom among
kings! I am delighted, and truly, I'm already in the mood to make a rhyme
of it: —

— even if it turns out to be a rhyme that is not suitable for everyone's
ears. Long ago I gave up being considerate of long ears. Well then! Well
now!

(But here it happened that the ass too got in a word; and clearly and
malevolently he said hee—yaw.)

Once — I think in anno domini one —

The Sybil said, drunk, though wine she'd had none:

‘Oh no, how badly things go!

198

Fourth auol Final Part



Decline! Decline! The world has sunk so low!
Rome sank to whore and to a whorehouse too,

Rome's Caesar to beast, God himself— turned Jew!”

2

The kings were enchanted by these rhymes of Zarathustra, but the king
to the right spoke: “Oh Zarathustra, how well we did in going forth to see
you!

For your enemies showed us your image in their mirror: there you were
with your devil's grimace and laughing scornfully, such that we were afraid
of you.

But what good did it do? Again and again you pricked our ears and
hearts with your sayings, then we said at last: what does it matter how he
looks!

We have to hear him, the one who teaches ‘you shall love peace as a
means to new wars, and the short peace more than the long one!'I

No one has ever spoken such warlike words: ‘What is good? Being brave
is good. The good war hallows any cause.'

I The frequent quotes of Zarathustra throughout Part IV are not verbatim but close enough to
indicate that Zarathustra‘s words have caught on and are being interpreted with Varying degrees
of success: Parts I and II appeared in 1883, Part III was written later in 1883 and early 1884, and
published in 1884 7 it was intended as the ﬁnal part of TSZ: Part IV was originally planned as a
separate work under the title “Noon and Eternity,” but Nietzsche found no publisher for it, and
decided instead to make it the fourth part of TSZ and to publish it at his own expense: Part IV
appeared in only 40 copies in 1885, and was distributed to friends only: In 1886 the ﬁrst edition
of TSZ Parts [7111 appeared; the complete work in four parts did not appear until 1892: When
Nietzsche boasts in line Homo (Kritische Stuoliertausgahe VI:341) that he needed no more than ten
days to ﬁnish each part ofTSZ, the information is misleading if we do not also consider his method
of composition: The ten—day periods do not refer to the idea and its execution in the Various
parables, speeches, frame narratives, characters etc, i.e: each part did not take ten days from start
to ﬁnish: This can be illustrated by the fact that the ﬁnal aphorism of The Gay Science, as well as
notes from the period, already deal with Zarathustra: Instead, Nietzsche constantly worked out
Various drafts related to the basic Zarathustra idea, often even during his long walks, and these he
copied into larger notebooks at home: When he sat down to compose one of the parts of TSZ, it
then took him approximately ten days to structure his already existing material into its ﬁnished
literary form (see Kritische Stuoliertausgahe XIV: 280—2): When Nietzsche speaks in line Homo of
his phenomenal inspiration, and how ideas simply ﬂooded over and through him (“I never had
a choice,” Kritische Stuoliertausgahe VI:339), this should not be taken to mean that he experienced
four ten—day periods of Zarathustra inspiration: Nietzsche, Jung, Kaufmann all appear to have
contributed to this myth: Part IV differs structurally from the earlier parts but also in tone; it
represents a very sober “revisiting” of the original work, a retreat from the teaching and preaching,
includes several “dithyrambs” later revised and added to the Diortysus Dithyramhs, and displays a
narrow scope ofinteraction with only “higher men.” Notably it takes place entirely on Zarathustra‘s
mountain:

I99

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Oh Zarathustra, our fathers' blood stirred in our bodies at the sound
of such words; it was like the speech of springtime to old casks of wine.

When swords ran every which way like red—stained snakes, our fathers
warmed to life; the sun of all peace seemed limp and lackluster to them,
but the long peace caused them shame.

How they sighed, our fathers, when they saw gleaming bright, dried up
swords on the wall! Like them, they thirsted for war. For a sword wants
to drink blood and sparkles with desire.” —

— As the kings talked in this manner and gabbed enthusiastically about
the happiness of their fathers, Zarathustra was overcome by no small
desire to mock their enthusiasm; after all, these were visibly very peaceful
kings he saw standing before him, the kind with old and reﬁned faces.
But he restrained himself. “Well then!” he said. “The path leads there,
Zarathustra's cave lies there, and this day shall also have a long evening!
But now a cry of distress hurries me away from you.

It will honor my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it, but, to be sure,
you will have to wait long!

Alright! What's the harm? Where does one learn to wait better today
than at court? And the whole virtue of kings that is left to them — is it not
today called: heihg ahle to wait?”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Leech

And Zarathustra walked on pensively, farther and deeper through woods
and past swampy valleys; but as happens to anyone who reﬂects on grave
matters, he unintentionally stepped on someone. And behold, all at once
he was sprayed in the face with one scream of pain and two curses and
twenty wicked invectives, such that in his fright he raised his staff and also
started beating the man he had just stepped on. Immediately thereupon
he gained his composure, and his heart laughed at the folly that he had
just committed.

“Forgive me,” he said to the man he had stepped on, who stood up
grimly and then sat down. “Forgive and partake, above all, in a parable
ﬁrst.

Of how a wanderer who is dreaming of distant things unintentionally
stumbles over a sleeping dog on a lonely lane, a dog lying in the sun:

200

— how both startle then, and attack each other like deathly enemies,
these two who are scared to death: so it went with us too.

And yet! And yet — how little was missing and they would have caressed
each other, this dog and this lonely man! Are they not after all both —
lonely!”

— “Whoever you may be,” said the stepped on man, still grimly, “you
step on my dignity with your parable too, and not only with your foot!

See here, am I some kind of dog?” — and then the sitting man got up
and pulled his bare arm out of the swamp. Because at ﬁrst he had lain
stretched out on the ground, hidden and unrecognizable like those who
lie in wait for swamp quarry.

“But what in blazes are you doing!” cried Zarathustra, shocked. For he
saw that much blood was ﬂowing over the man's bare arm. “You wretch,
did some wicked beast bite you?”

The bleeding man laughed, but still angrily. “What concern is it of
yours!” he said, and made to leave. “Here I am at home and in my territory.
Anyone who wants may question me, but I will hardly answer a stumbling
fool.”

“You are mistaken,” said Zarathustra, with pity, and he held on to him.
“You are mistaken: here you are not in your home, but in my realm, and
in here no one comes to harm.

Meanwhile call me whatever you want — I am who I must be. I call
myself Zarathustra.

Well then! Up there is the path to Zarathustra's cave; it isn't far —
wouldn't you like to care for your wounds at my place?

Things have gone badly for you in this life, you wretch; ﬁrst you
were bitten by the beasts, and then — you were stepped on by a human
being!” —

But when the stepped on man heard the name of Zarathustra, he trans—
formed. “What is happening to me!” he cried out. “Who concerns me
anymore in this life other than this one person, namely Zarathustra, and
that one animal that lives off blood, the leech?

For the leech's sake I lay here at this swamp like a ﬁsher, and already my
outstretched arm had been bitten ten times, then an even more beautiful
leech bites on my blood, Zarathustra himself!

Oh happiness! Oh miracle! Praised be the day that lured me to this
swamp! Praised be the best, liveliest cupping glass living today, praised
be the great conscience—leech Zarathustra!” —

201

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Thus spoke the stepped on man; and Zarathustra was pleased at his
words and their ﬁne, respectful manner. “Who are you?” he said, and
offered him his hand. “Between us there is much to clear up and to cheer
up; but already it seems to me the day is growing pure and bright.”

“I am the eohseieutious of spirit,” answered the man, “and in matters of
the spirit one can hardly be more rigorous, Vigorous and venomous than
I, except the one from whom I learned it, Zarathustra himself.

Rather know nothing, than know much half way! Rather be a fool in
one's own right than a wise man according to strangers. I — go to the
ground of things:

— what does it matter whether it is big or small? Whether it is called
swamp or sky? A hand's breadth of ground is enough for me, if only it is
real ground and bottom!

— a hand's breadth of ground: on that one can stand. In proper science
and conscience there is nothing great and nothing small.”

“So perhaps you are the expert on the leech?” asked Zarathustra. “And
you pursue the leech down to its ultimate grounds, you conscientious
one?”

“Oh Zarathustra,” answered the stepped on man. “That would be a
monstrous undertaking, how could I presume to such a thing!

What I am master and expert of, however, is the leech's hraiu — that is
my world!

And it is a world too! But forgive me that my pride speaks up here, for
in this matter I have no equal. That is why I said ‘here I am at home.'

How long already have I pursued this one thing, the brain of the leech,
so that the slippery truth no longer slips away from me here? Here is my
realm!

— this is why I threw away everything else, this is why all else is the
same to me; and right next to my knowledge my black ignorance lurks.

My conscience of spirit wants of me that I know one thing and do not
know everything else; I am nauseated by all halfness of spirit, all hazy,
soaring, rapturous people.

Where my honesty ceases I am blind and also want to be blind. But
where I want to know, I also want to be honest, namely venomous, rigorous,
vigorous, cruel and inexorable.

That you once said, oh Zarathustra: ‘Spirit is the life that itself cuts
into life,' that induced and seduced me to your teaching. And truly, with
my own blood I increased my own knowledge!”

202

Fourth auol Final Part



— “And it shows too,” interrupted Zarathustra; for blood was still ﬂow—
ing from the bare arm of the conscientious one. No fewer than ten leeches,
after all, had bored themselves into it.

“Oh you weird fellow, how much is revealed to me by your appearance,
namely you yourself! And maybe I should not pour all of it into your
rigorous ears!

Well then! Let's part here! But I would like to ﬁnd you again. Up there
leads the path to my cave; tonight you shall be my dear guest there!

I would also like to make it up to your body that Zarathustra stepped
on you with his feet; I'll be thinking about that. But now a cry of distress
hurries me away from you.”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Magician

But as Zarathustra made his way around a boulder he saw someone not
far below him on the same path, ﬂailing his limbs like a raving madman,
who ﬁnally ﬂopped belly—ﬁrst to the ground. “Stop!” said Zarathustra
to his heart. “That one there must be the higher man, that awful cry of
distress came from him — I'll go see if I can help.” But when he ran to
the spot where the person lay on the ground, he found a trembling old
man with a ﬁxed gaze; and as hard as Zarathustra tried to prop him up
and stand him on his feet again, it was in vain. Nor did the unfortunate
man seem to notice that someone was with him; instead he kept looking
around with pitiful gestures, like someone who had been abandoned and
left stranded by the whole world. At last, however, after much trembling
and twitching and writhing he began to wail thus:

Who will warm me, who loves me still?

Give me hot hands!

Give me braziers for my heart!

Laid out, shuddering,

Like something half—dead whose feet one warms 7
Racked, oh! by unknown fevers,

Shivering from pointy icy arrows of frost,

Hunted by you, thought!

Unnameable! Disguised! Horrendous one!

You hunter behind clouds!

Struck down by your lightning,

You scornful eye that looks at me from darkness:

Doubled up, writhing, tortured

By all eternal torments,

Struck

By you, cruelest hunter,

You unknown 7 god!

Strike deeper,

Strike one more time!
Skewer, smash this heart!
Why this torment

With blunt—toothed arrows?
Why do you look again,

Not weary of human agony,
With gloating gods' eyes ﬂashing lightning?
You do not want to kill,

Only torment, torment?

Why torment me,

You gloating unknown god? 7

Aha! You sneak close?

At such midnight

What do you want? Speak!

You press me, squeeze me 7

Ha! too close already!

Away! Away!

You hear me breathing,

You jealous one 7

But of what are you jealous?

Away! Away! Why the ladder?

Do you want in,

Into my heart,

To climb in, to climb into

My most secret thoughts?
Shameless one! Unknown 7 thief!
What would you gain by stealing,
What would you gain by eavesdropping,
What would you gain by torturing,

Not dog, only your prey am I,

Cruelest hunter!

Your proudest captive,

You robber behind clouds!

You disguised in lightning! Unknown one! Speak,
What do you want, unknown god? 7

Why do you want ransom?

And speak brieﬂy 7 thus my other pride counsels!
Aha!

Aha!

And you torment me, fool that you are,
Torment my pride?

Give me love 7 who will warm me still?
Who loves me still? 7 give me hot hands,
Give me braziers for my heart,

— But at this point Zarathustra could no longer restrain himself, grabbed
his staff and began beating the wailing man with all his strength. “Shut
up!” he cried to him, with grim laughter. “Shut up, you actor! You
counterfeiter! You liar from top to bottom! I recognize you well!

I'll give you warm legs, you wicked magician, I'm very good at heating
up people like you!”

— “Desist,” said the old man and he leaped to his feet. “Beat me no
more, oh Zarathustra! I only did this as a game!

Such things belong to my art; you yourself I wanted to put to the test,
when I gave you this test. And verily, you saw through me well!

But you yourself— you also tested me with no small sample of yourself:
you are harol, you Wise Zarathustra! You hit hard With your ‘truths,' your
cudgel forces this truth out of me!”

— “Do not ﬂatter,” answered Zarathustra, still upset and frowning
darkly, “you actor from top to bottom! You're fake — why do you talk
— of truth!

You peacock of peacocks, you sea of vanity, what are you playing before
me, you wicked magician, in whom am I supposed to believe when you
wail in this form?”

“ The pehiteht of the spirit,” said the old man. “H im I played: you yourself
once coined this phrase —

206

Fourth auol Final Part



— the poet and magician who ultimately turns his spirit against himself,
the transformed one who freezes to death from his own evil science and
conscience.

And just admit it: it took you a long time, oh Zarathustra, before you
saw through my art and lie! You helieveol in my distress when you cradled
my head with both hands —

— I heard you wail ‘they loved him too little, loved him too little!' That I
was able to deceive you to such an extent, that causes my malice to jubilate
secretly.”

“You may have deceived ﬁner heads than me,” said Zarathustra harshly.
“I am not on my guard for deceivers, I have to be without caution — my
fate wants it so.

But you — have to deceive: that much I know about you! You always
have to be e—quivocal, tri—, quad— and quinquivocal! Even what you just
now confessed was not nearly true nor false enough for me!

You wicked counterfeiter, how could you do otherwise! You would
even put make—up on your disease when you show yourself naked to your
physician.

Just like you put make—up on your lie before me when you said ‘I only
did this as a game!' There was earnest in it, you are something of a penitent
of the spirit!

I guessed you well: you became everyone's enchanter, but against your—
self you have no lie and no guile left over — you are disenchanted of
yourself!

You harvested nausea as your single truth. Not a word of yours is
genuine anymore, except your mouth: namely the nausea that clings to
your mouth.” —

— “Who are you!” yelled the old magician at this point, with deﬁ—
ance in his voice. “Who is permitted to speak with me thus, the greatest
person living today?” — and an emerald bolt of lightning shot from his
eye toward Zarathustra. But then he transformed immediately and said
sadly:

“Oh Zarathustra, I am weary of and nauseated by my arts, I am not
great, why do I pretend! But, you know it well — I sought greatness!

I wanted to represent a great human being and I persuaded many; but
this lie was beyond my powers. On it I break down.

Oh Zarathustra, everything about me is a lie; but that I am breaking
down — this breaking down is genuine!” —

207

Thus S polee Zara thustra



“It does you honor,” spoke Zarathustra somberly and glancing down to
the side, “it does you honor that you sought greatness, but it also betrays
you. You are not great.

You wicked old magician, that is your best and most honest, and what
I honor in you, namely that you wearied of yourself and said so: ‘I am not
great.'

In that I honor you as a penitent of the spirit; and even if it was only
for a whiff and a wink, for this one moment you were — genuine.

But tell me, what do you seek here in my woods and cliffs? And when
you laid yourself in my path, what did you want to test in me? —

— why did you research me?” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra, and his eyes ﬂashed. The old magician
was silent for a while, then he said: “Did I research you? I merely —
search.

Oh Zarathustra, I seek someone who is genuine, proper, simple,
unequivocal, a human being of all honesty, a vessel of wisdom, a saint
of knowledge, a great human being!

Do you not know it, oh Zarathustra? I seele Zarathustra.”

— And here a long silence ensued between the two; but Zarathustra
became deeply immersed in himself, such that he closed his eyes. But
then, turning back to his interlocutor, he seized the hand of the magician
and spoke, full of kindness and craftiness:

“Well then! Up there leads the path, there lies the cave of Zarathustra.
In it you may seek whomever you wish to ﬁnd.

And ask my animals for advice, my eagle and my snake: they shall help
you seek. But my cave is big.

For my part — I've never seen a great human being. The eyes of the
ﬁnest are too coarse today for what is great. It is the kingdom of the
rabble.

Many a one I found already, who stretched and puffed himself up, and
the people cried: ‘See here, a great human being!' But what good are all
bellows! In the end only wind comes out.

In the end a frog will burst if it puffs itself up too long: then only wind
comes out. To stab a swollen person in the belly — that's what I call great
fun. Hear me, you little boys!

Today belongs to the rabble; who lehows anymore what is great, what
is small! Who could successfully search for greatness! Only a fool — fools
would succeed.

208

Fourth auol Final Part



You seek great human beings, you queer fool? Who taught you that? Is
the time for that today? Oh you wicked searcher — why do you research
me?” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra, comforted in his heart, and off he went again
on his way, laughing.

Retired

Not long after he had freed himself from the magician, however, Zarathus—
tra again saw someone sitting beside the path that he walked, namely a tall
man in black with a gaunt, pale face: this man dismayed him tremendously.
“Oh no,” he spoke to his heart, “there sits depression in disguise, and its
looks remind me of priests: what do they want in my kingdom?

What! Scarcely did I escape that magician, now another practitioner of
black arts has to cross my path —

— some kind of sorcerer with laying—on of hands, a dark miracle
worker of God's grace, an anointed world slanderer, may the devil take
him!

But the devil is never in place where he would be in the right place; he
always comes too late, this damned dwarf and Clubfoot!” —

Thus cursed Zarathustra impatiently in his heart and he considered
how he might avert his gaze and slip by the man in black; but behold, it
happened differently. For in the same moment the sitting man had already
caught sight of him, and not unlike a person who has run into unexpected
luck, he leaped to his feet and approached Zarathustra.

“Whoever you may be, you wanderer,” he said, “help a lost, seeking
old man who could easily come to harm here!

This world here is foreign to me and far off, I even heard wild beasts
howling; and the one who could have offered me protection, he himself
no longer exists.

I sought the last pious human being, a saint and a hermit who alone in
his woods had not yet heard what the whole world today knows.”

“What does the whole world know today?” asked Zarathustra. “This
perhaps, that the old God no longer lives, the one in whom the whole
world once believed?”

“You said it,” answered the old man gloomily. “And I served this old
God until his ﬁnal hour.

209

Thus S polee Zara thustra



But now I am retired, without a master, and yet I am not free, nor merry
for a single hour unless in my memories.

And so I climbed into these mountains to ﬁnally have a festival for
myself, as is proper for an old pope and church father: for know this, I
am the last pope! — a festival of pious memories and divine worship.

But now he himself is dead, this most pious human being, this saint in
the woods who constantly praised his god with singing and growling.

I did not ﬁnd him when I found his hut — but two wolves were in it,
howling at his death — for all animals loved him. Then I ran away.

Did I arrive in vain in these woods and mountains? Then my heart
resolved to seek another, the most pious of all those who do not believe in
God — to seek Zarathustra!”

Thus spoke the oldster and he looked with a sharp eye at the man
who stood before him; but Zarathustra grasped the old pope's hand and
regarded it admiringly for a long time.

“See here, you reverend one,” he said then, “what a beautiful and long
hand! This is the hand of one who has always dispensed blessings. Now,
however, it holds on to the one you seek, to me, Zarathustra.

I am he, godless Zarathustra, who speaks: who is more godless than I,
that I may enjoy his instruction?” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra and with his gaze he penetrated the thoughts
and secret thoughts of the old pope. At last the latter began:

“The one who loved and possessed him most has now also lost him
most — :

— behold, perhaps I myself am now the more godless of us two? But
who could take pleasure in that!” —

“You served him up until the end,” said Zarathustra, pensively, after a
deep silence. “Do you know how he died? Is it true, as they say, that pity
choked him to death,

— that he saw how the human heiug hung on the cross, and couldn't bear
that his love for mankind became his hell and ultimately his death?” —

But the old pope did not answer, and instead he looked to the side
awkwardly and with a pained and dark expression.

“Let him go,” said Zarathustra after a long thoughtful pause, while still
looking the old man straight in the eye.

“Let him go, he's gone. And even though it honors you that you speak
only good of this dead one, still you know as well as I who he was; and that
he walked queer ways.”

210

Fourth auol Final Part



“For our three eyes only,” said the old pope cheerfully (because he
was blind in one eye), “in matters of God I am more enlightened than
Zarathustra himself — and am permitted to be.

My love served him long years, my will followed his will in all things.
But a good servant knows everything, and also some things that his master
conceals from himself.

He was a concealed god, full of secretiveness. Indeed, even in getting
himself a son he used nothing other than sneaky means. At the doorway
of his faith stands adultery.

Whoever praises him as a god of love does not think highly enough of
love itself. Did this god not also want to be judge? But the loving one loves
beyond reward and retribution.

When he was young, this god from the East, then he was harsh and
vengeful and he built himself a hell for the amusement of his favorites.

But at last he became old and soft and mellow and pitying, more like a
grandfather than a father, but most like a wobbly old grandmother.

There he sat, wilted, in his nook by the stove, grousing about his weak
legs, weary of the world, weary of willing, and one day he choked to death
on his all too great pity.” —

“You old pope,” said Zarathustra here, interrupting. “Did you see that
with your own eyes? It certainly could have happened that way; that way,
auol another way too. When gods die, they always die many kinds of death.

But well then! This way or that, this way and that — he's gone! He was
offensive to the taste of my ears and eyes, I do not wish to speak anything
worse of him.

I love everything that gazes brightly and speaks honestly. But he — you
know it well, you old priest, there was something of your kind in him,
something priest—like — he was equivocal.

He was also unclear. How he raged at us, this wrath snorter, because
we understood him poorly! But why did he not speak more purely!

And if the fault was in our ears, why did he give us ears that heard him
poorly? If mud was in our ears, well then — who put it there?

He failed at too much, this potter who never completed his training! But
that he avenged himself on his clay formations and his creations because
they turned out badly for him — that was a sin against goool taste.

In piousness too there is good taste; it said at last: “Away with such a
god! Rather no god, rather meet destiny on one's own, rather be a fool,
rather be a god oneself!”

211

Thus S polee Zara thustra



— “What do I hear!” spoke the old pope at this point with pricked
up ears. “Oh Zarathustra, you are more pious than you believe, with
such disbelief! Some kind of god in you converted you to your god—
lessness.

Is it not your very piousness that no longer allows you to believe in a
god? And your overly great honesty will yet lead you away beyond good
and evil!

Take a good look: what is left for you? You have eyes and hands and
mouth that have been preordained for blessing since eternity. One does
not bless with hands alone.

In your proximity, even though you claim to be the most godless man,
I detect a secret, sacred and sweet aroma of long blessings: it makes me
happy and it makes me hurt.

Let me be your guest, oh Zarathustra, for one single night! Nowhere
on earth do I feel happier now than with you!” —

“Amen! It shall be so!” spoke Zarathustra with great astonishment.
“Up there leads the path, there lies the cave of Zarathustra.

Gladly, to be sure, I would guide you there myself, you reverend one,
because I love all pious people. But now a cry of distress hurries me away
from you.

In my realm no one shall come to harm; my cave is a safe harbor. And
I would like nothing better than to place every sad person back on ﬁrm
land and ﬁrm legs.

But who could take your melancholy off your shoulders? For that I'm
too weak. We may have to wait a long time, truly, before someone awakens
your god again.

For this old god does not live anymore: he is thoroughly dead.” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The Ugliest Human Being

— And again Zarathustra's feet ran through mountains and woods, and his
eyes searched and searched, but nowhere to be seen was the one whom
they wanted to see, the great sufferer of distress and crier of distress. But
along the whole way he jubilated in his heart and was thankful. “What
good things,” he said, “this day has bestowed on me, as compensation for
having begun so badly! What strange interlocutors I found!

212

Fourth auol Final Part



Now I want to chew on their words for a long time, as on good kernels;
my teeth will grind and grate them down until they ﬂow like milk into
my soul!” —

But when the path disappeared again around a boulder, all at once the
landscape changed and Zarathustra stepped into a realm of death. Here
black and red cliffs jutted upward: no grass, no tree, no birdsong. For
it was a valley that all animals avoided, even the predators; except for a
species of hideous, thick, green snakes that would come here to die when
they grew old. And for this reason the shepherds called this valley: Snake
Death.

Now Zarathustra sank into a black reminiscence, for it seemed to him
that he had already stood in this valley once before. And much graveness
spread itself over his mind, such that he walked slowly and ever more
slowly until ﬁnally he stood still. But then, when he opened his eyes he
saw something sitting beside the path, shaped like a human but scarcely
like a human, something unspeakable. And all of a sudden Zarathustra
was overcome with great shame for having looked upon such a thing with
his own eyes; blushing all the way up to his white hair, he averted his gaze
and picked up his foot, intending to leave this wicked spot. But then a
noise animated the dead wasteland; it welled up from the ground gurgling
and rattling, like water gurgles and rattles at night through clogged water
pipes, until ﬁnally it turned into a human voice and human speech — that
sounded like this.

“Zarathustra! Zarathustra! Guess my riddle! Speak, speak! What is
revenge against the witness?

I lure you back, there is slippery ice here! See to it, see to it that your
pride does not break its legs here!

You consider yourselfwise, you proud Zarathustra! Then go ahead and
guess the riddle, you hard nut cracker — the riddle that I am! So tell me:
who am I ?”

— But when Zarathustra had heard these words — what do you think
took place in his soul? He was overwhelmeol with pity; and he collapsed at
once like an oak tree that has long withstood many wood cutters — heavily,
suddenly, to the terror of even those who wanted to fell it. But right away
he picked himself up from the ground and his face had become hard.

“I recognize you alright,” he spoke with a voice of bronze: “ You are the
murderer of Cool! Let me go.

213

Thus S polee Zara thustra



You could not hear the one who saw you — who saw you always and
through and through, you ugliest human being! You took revenge on this
witness!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra and wanted to leave; but the unspeakable one
latched on to a corner of his garment and began again to gurgle and to
search for words. “Stay!” he said at last —

— “Stay! Do not pass by! I guessed what kind of axe knocked you to the
ground: Hail to you, oh Zarathustra, that you stand again!

You guessed, I know it well, how he who killed him feels — the murderer
of God. Stay! Sit down here with me, it will not be in vain.

To whom did I want to go, if not to you? Stay, sit down! But do not
look at me! Honor thus — my ugliness!

They persecute me; now you are my last refuge. N ot with their hatred,
hot with their bailiffs — oh such persecution I would mock and be proud
and glad!

Has not everything successful hitherto been done by the well—
persecuted? And whoever persecutes well easily learns to sueeeeol — after
all he is already — after somebody! But it's their pity —

— their pity is what I ﬂee and why I ﬂee to you. Oh Zarathustra, protect
me, you my last refuge, you the only one to guess me:

— you guessed how he who killed him feels. Stay! And if you want to
go, you impatient one: do not go the way that I came. That way is bad.

Are you angry with me that I've already spoken broken words for too
long? That I even counsel you? But know this, it's me, the ugliest human
being,

— who also has the biggest, heaviest feet. Where I walked, the way is
bad. I trample all ways to death and to ruin.

But that you passed me by, silently; that you blushed, I saw it well:
that's how I recognized you as Zarathustra.

Any other would have tossed me his alms, his pity, with looks and
speech. But for that — I am not beggar enough, you guessed that —

—for that I am too rich, rich in what is great, what is terrible, what is
ugliest, what is most unspeakable! Your shame, oh Zarathustra, hohoreol
me!

With difﬁculty I managed to escape the throng of the pitying — to
ﬁnd the only one today who teaches ‘pitying is obtrusive' — you, oh
Zarathustra!

214

— Be it a god's, be it the pity of mankind: pitying is offensive to shame.
And not wanting to help can be more noble than the virtue that leaps to
help.

But today that is what passes for virtue itself among all small people,
pity — they have no respect for great misfortune, for great ugliness, for
great failure.

I look away over all these people like a dog looks away over the backs
of teeming ﬂocks of sheep. They are small, good—wooled and good—willed
gray people.

Like a heron looks away contemptuously over shallow ponds, its head
tossed back; thus I look away over teeming gray little waves and wills and
souls.

They have been deemed to be right for too long, these small people;
and so in the end they were given might too — now they teach: ‘the only
good is what small people call good.'

And ‘truth' today is what the preacher spoke, the one who himselfcame
from among them, that odd holy man and advocate of small people who
testiﬁed of himself: ‘I — am the truth.'

This immodest person has for a long time now caused small people to
get big heads — he who taught no small error when he taught ‘I — am the
truth.'

Was an immodest person ever answered more courteously? — But you,
oh Zarathustra, passed him by and said: ‘No! No! Three times no!'

You warned against his error, you were the ﬁrst to warn against pity —
not all, not none, but yourself and your kind.

You are ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and indeed, when
you say ‘from pitying a great cloud is coming, beware, you human beings!'

— when you teach ‘all creators are hard, all great love is above pitying': oh
Zarathustra, how well schooled you seem to me in predicting the weather!

But you yourself— warn yourselftoo againstyourpitying! Because many
are on their way to you, many who are suffering, doubting, despairing,
drowning, freezing —

I warn you against me too. You guessed my best and worst riddle, me
myself and what I did. I know the axe that fells you.

But he — haol to die: he saw with eyes that saw everything — he saw
the depths and grounds of human beings, all their hidden disgrace and
ugliness.

215

Thus S polee Zara thustra



His pitying knew no shame: he crawled into my ﬁlthiest nook. This
most curious, super—obtrusive, super—pitying one had to die.

He always saw me: I wanted revenge on such a witness — or to no longer
live myself.

The god who saw everything, even humau heihgs: this god had to die!
Human beings cannot hear that such a witness lives.”

Thus spoke the ugliest human being. But Zarathustra rose and set
about to leave, because he was chilled down to his entrails.

“You unspeakable one,” he said, “you warned me against your way. Out
of gratitude I now commend mine to you. Look, up there lies Zarathustra's
cave.

My cave is big and deep and has many nooks; there the most hidden
person will ﬁnd a hiding place. And close by are a hundred burrows and
tunnels for crawling, ﬂapping and leaping wildlife.

You outcast, who cast himself out, you no longer want to dwell among
human beings and human pity? Well then, do as I do! Thus you'll also
learn from me; only the doer learns.

And speak ﬁrst and foremost with my animals! The proudest animal
and the wisest animal — they are surely the right counselors for both of
us!” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra and continued on his way, pensive and even
more slowly than before; because he had much to ask himself and knew
no easy way to answer.

“How poor indeed is a human being!” he thought in his heart, “how
ugly, how gasping, how full of concealed shame!

They tell me that human beings love themselves; oh, how great this
self—love must be! How much contempt it has against it!

Even this man here loved himself, as he despised himself — to me he
seems a great lover and a great despiser.

I've never found anyone who despised himself more deeply; that too is
elevation. Oh 110, was he perhaps the higher man whose cry I heard?

I love the great despisers. Human being, however, is something that
must be overcome.” —

The Voluntary Beggar

When Zarathustra had left the ugliest human being, he was freezing and
he felt lonely; after all, so much that was cold and lonely went through his

216

mind, to the point where even his limbs grew colder because of it. But as
he climbed further and further, up, down, now past green meadows, but
then also across wild stony deposits where previously an impatient brook
might have laid itself to bed, then all at once his mood became warmer
and more cordial.

“What happened to me?” he asked himself, “something warm and lively
refreshes me, something that must be close to me.

Already I am less alone; unknown companions and brothers roam
around me, their warm breath touches on my soul.”

But when he peered about himself and searched for the comforters
of his solitude, oddly enough, it was cows huddled together on a knoll;
their nearness and smell had warmed his heart. Now these cows seemed
engrossed in listening to someone speaking, and they paid no atten—
tion to the one who approached them. But when Zarathustra was quite
near them he heard clearly how a human voice spoke from the midst
of the cows; and evidently they had all turned their heads toward the
speaker.

Then Zarathustra leaped up eagerly and pushed the animals apart,
fearing that someone might have come to harm here, which could scarcely
be remedied by the pity of cows. But in this he had deceived himself; for
indeed, there sat someone on the ground and appeared to be persuading
the animals to not be afraid of him, a peaceful man and mountain preacher
from whose eyes goodness itself preached. “What are you seeking here?”
cried Zarathustra, astonished.

“What am I seeking here?” he answered: “The same thing you seek,
you trouble maker! Namely happiness on earth.

But for that I want to learn from these cows. And you should know,
I've already persuaded them half the morning, and just now they wanted
to tell me for sure. Why do you have to disturb them?

Unless we are converted and become as cows, we will by no means enter
the kingdom of heaven. For there is one thing that we ought to learn from
them: chewing the cud.

And truly, what proﬁt is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and did
not learn this one thing, chewing the cud: what would it help? He would
not be rid of his misery

— his great misery: which today is called nausea. Who today does not
have heart, mouth and eyes full of nausea? You too! You too! But just look
at these cows here!” —

217

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Thus spoke the mountain preacher and then he turned his own gaze
on Zarathustra — for till now his gaze hung lovingly on the cows — then,
however, it transformed. “Who is this with whom I speak?” he cried,
startled, and jumped up from the ground.

“This is the man without nausea, this is Zarathustra himself, the one
who overcame great nausea, this is the eye, this is the mouth, this is the
heart of Zarathustra himself.”

And while he spoke thus he kissed the hands of the one to whom
he spoke, and tears streamed from his eyes, and he behaved quite
like someone to whom a precious gift and treasure falls unexpect—
edly from heaven. The cows, meanwhile, watched all of this and were
amazed.

“Do not speak of me, you odd, you lovely man!” said Zarathustra and
he restrained his tenderness. “Tell me ﬁrst about yourself! Are you not
the voluntary beggar who once threw away great wealth —

— who once was ashamed of his wealth and of the wealthy, and ﬂed to
the poorest people, to give them his fullness and his heart? But they did
not accept him.”

“But they did not accept me,” said the voluntary beggar, “you know it
already. So in the end I went to the animals and to these cows.”

“Then you learned,” Zarathustra interrupted the speaker, “how it is
harder to grant right than to take right, and that bestowing well is an art
and the ultimate, craftiest master—art of kindness.”

“Especially nowadays,” answered the voluntary beggar. “Nowadays,
namely, where everything lowly has become rebellious and skittish and
haughty in its own way: namely in a rabble way.

For the hour has come, you know it well, for the great, terrible, long,
slow rabble and slave rebellion: it grows and grows!

Now the lowly are outraged by all benevolence and little charities; and
the super—rich should be on their guard!

Whoever dribbles these days like portly bottles with all too narrow
necks — people like to break the necks of such bottles today.

Lascivious greed, galling envy, aggrieved vengefulness, rabble pride:
all of that leaped into my face. It is no longer true that the poor are blessed.
But the kingdom of heaven is among the cows.”

“And why is it not among the wealthy?” asked Zarathustra, temptingly,
as he warded off the cows that trustingly snorted at the peaceful man.

218

Fourth auol Final Part



“Why do you tempt me?” he answered. “You yourself know it even
better than I. What drove me to the poorest, oh Zarathustra? Was it not
my nausea for our wealthiest people?

— for the convicts of wealth who cull their advantage out of every
dustpan, with cold eyes, horny thoughts; for this mob that stinks to high
heaven,

— for this gilded, fake rabble, whose fathers were pick—pockets or vul—
tures or rag pickers, with women who were willing, lascivious, forgetful
— all of them after all are not far from being whores —

rabble above, rabble below! What do ‘poor' and ‘rich' mean anymore
today! I forgot this difference — then I ﬂed, farther, ever farther, until I
got to these cows.”

Thus spoke the peaceful man and he himself snorted and sweated at
these words, such that the cows once again were amazed. But Zarathustra
continued to look him in the face, smiling as he spoke so harshly, and he
silently shook his head.

“You do violence to yourself, you mountain preacher, when you use
such harsh words. Not for such harshness were your mouth or your eyes
made.

Nor, it seems to me, your stomach itself: it resists all such raging and
hating and foaming over. Your stomach wants gentler things: you are no
butcher.

Rather, you seem to me a vegetarian and a root man. Perhaps you crunch
grains. But certainly you are ill disposed toward pleasures of the ﬂesh and
you love honey.”

“You guessed me well,” responded the voluntary beggar, with relief in
his heart. “I love honey, I also crunch grains, because I sought what tastes
lovely and makes for clean breath:

— also what takes a long time, a day's and mouth's work for gentle idlers
and bums.

The ones who have excelled the most, to be sure, are these cows: they
invented chewing the cud for themselves and lying in the sun. They also
refrain from all weighty thoughts, which bloat the heart.”

— “Well then!” said Zarathustra. “You should also see my animals, my
eagle and my snake — their equal exists nowhere today on earth.

Look, there the path leads to my cave; be its guest tonight. And speak
with my animals about the happiness of animals —

219

Thus S polee Zara thustra



— until I myself come home. Because now a cry of distress hurries me
away from you. You'll also ﬁnd new honey at my place, icy—fresh golden
honey from the comb — eat it!

But now quickly take leave of your cows, you odd, you lovely man!
Even if it is difﬁcult for you. For they are your warmest friends and
teachers!” —

“— With the exception of one person, whom I love even more,” answered
the voluntary beggar. “You yourself are good and even better than a cow,
oh Zarathustra!”

“Away, away With you! You nasty ﬂatterer!” cried Zarathustra With
malice, “why do you spoil me with such praise and ﬂatter—honey?

Away, away from me!” he cried once more and brandished his staff at
the affectionate beggar, who ran away swiftly.

The Shadow

But scarcely had the voluntary beggar run away and Zarathustra was again
alone with himself, than he heard a new voice behind him, crying “Stop!
Zarathustra! Stop already! It's me, oh Zarathustra, me, your shadow!”
But Zarathustra did not wait, because he was suddenly overcome with
annoyance at the excessive hustle and bustle in his mountains. “Where's
my solitude gone?” he said.

“This is really becoming too much for me; this mountain is teeming,
my kingdom is no longer of this world, I need new mountains.

My shadow is calling me? What does my shadow matter! Let him run
after me — I'll run away from him.”

Thus Zarathustra spoke to his heart and ran away. But the one who was
behind him continued to follow, so that soon three runners were after each
other, namely the voluntary beggar in front, then Zarathustra and third
and furthest behind, his shadow. Not long had they run in this manner
when Zarathustra came to his senses about his folly and with one great
effort shook off all that cloyed and annoyed him.

“What!” he said, “haven't the most ridiculous things always happened
among us old hermits and holy men?

Truly, my folly grew tall in the mountains! Now I hear six old fools'
legs rattling along after each other!

220

Fourth auol Final Part



But can Zarathustra afford to be afraid of a shadow? And it seems to
me, when all's said and done, that he has longer legs than 1.”

Thus spoke Zarathustra, laughing with his eyes and his entrails, then
he stopped, turned around abruptly — and behold, he almost hurled his
successor and shadow to the ground — so closely did the latter follow on
his heels, and so weak was he too. When he took a close look at him, he
shrank back as if before a sudden ghost: so thin, blackish, hollow and
outdated did this successor look.

“Who are you?” asked Zarathustra, intensely, “what are you doing here?
And why do you call yourself my shadow? I don't like you.”

“Forgive me,” answered the shadow, “that it is I; and if you do not like
me, well then, oh Zarathustra, for that I praise you and your good taste!

I am a wanderer, who has already walked much at your heels; always
on my way, but without goal, without home too, such that very little is
lacking, truly, and I would be the Eternal Jew — except that I am not
eternal and neither am IJew.

What? Must I always be on my way? Whirled by every wind, unsteady,
driven out? Oh earth, you have become too round for me!

I've already sat on every surface, like weary dust I have slept on mirrors
and window panes: Everything takes from me, nothing gives, and I grow
thin — I almost resemble a shadow.

But after you, oh Zarathustra, I've ﬂown and followed longest, and even
when I concealed myself from you, I was still your best shadow: wherever
you sat, I sat too.

With you I have haunted the remotest, coldest worlds, like a ghost that
runs voluntarily over winter rooftops and snow.

With you I strived to enter everything forbidden, worst, remotest; and
if anything of mine is a virtue, then it is that I have feared no ban.

With you I smashed anything my heart ever honored, I overthrew all
boundary stones and images, I pursued the most dangerous wishes —
indeed, I have passed over every crime once.

With you I unlearned my faith in words and values and great names.
When the devil sheds his skin, does his name not fall off too? For it too is
skin. Perhaps the devil himself is — skin.

‘Nothing is true, all is permitted': thus I persuaded myself. I plunged
into the coldest waters, with head and heart. Oh how often I paid for it
by standing there naked as a red crab!

221

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Oh where has all my goodness and all my shame and all my faith in the
good gone! Oh where has that mendacious innocence that I once possessed
gone, the innocence of the good and their noble lies!

Too often, to be sure, I followed on the heels of truth: and it kicked me
in the head. Sometimes I believed I was lying and behold — that's where
I ﬁrst hit — the truth.

Too much became clear to me, now it doesn't matter to me anymore.
Nothing that I love lives anymore — how am I supposed to still love myself?

‘Live as I please or don't live at all' — that's how I want it, and that's
how the saintliest person wants it too. But alas, how could I still have —
pleasure?

Do I — still have a goal? A harbor toward which my sail turns?

A good wind? Indeed, only the one who knows where he's sailing knows
also which wind is good and which is his favorable wind.

What did I have left? A heart weary and insolent; a restless will; ﬂut—
tering wings; a broken backbone.

Ever a visitor, searching for my home, oh Zarathustra, you well know,
this visiting was my visitation, and it devours me.

‘Where is — my home?' I asked, and I search and searched for it, but I
have not found it. Oh eternal everywhere, oh eternal nowhere, oh eternal
— in vain!”

Thus spoke the shadow, and Zarathustra's face lengthened at these
words. “You are my shadow!” he said at last, with sadness.

“Your danger is no small one, you free spirit and wanderer! You've had
a bad day: see to it that you do not have an even worse evening!

To such restless ones as you even a jail ends up looking like bliss. Have
you ever seen how captured criminals sleep? They sleep peacefully, they
enjoy their new security.

Beware that you are not captured in the end by a narrow belief, a harsh,
severe delusion! Because now you are seduced and tempted by anything
that is narrow and solid.

You have lost your goal: indeed, how will you get rid of and get over
this loss? Along with it — you have also lost your way!

You poor roamer and raver, you weary butterﬂy! Do you want to have
a rest and a home this evening? Then go up to my cave!

There leads the path to my cave. And now I have to run away from you
quickly again. Already it's as though I'm covered in shadow.

222

Fourth auol Final Part



I want to run alone, so that things clear up around me again. For that
I'll yet have to be long on my legs and like it. But this evening at my place
— there will be dancing!” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

At Nooh

— And Zarathustra ran and ran and found no one anymore, and he was
alone and found himself again and again, and he enjoyed and sipped his
solitude and thought about good things — for hours. At the hour of noon,
however, as the sun stood directly over Zarathustra's head, he passed by
an old crooked and knotty tree, embraced by the luxurious love of a grape—
vine and hidden away from itself; from it hung abundant yellow grapes,
trailing toward the wanderer. Then he got a craving to quench a slight
thirst and to pluck himself a grape; but when he had already stretched out
his arm to do so, then he got an even stronger craving to do something
else, namely to lie down beside the tree, at the hour of perfect noon, and
to sleep.

This Zarathustra did; and as soon as he lay on the ground, in the
quiet and secrecy of the colorful grass, he quickly forgot about his slight
thirst and fell asleep. For, as Zarathustra's proverb says, one thing is more
needful than the other. Only his eyes remained open — because they did
not tire of seeing and praising the tree and the grapevine's love. As he was
falling asleep, however, Zarathustra spoke thus to his heart:

Still! Still! Didn't the world become perfect just now? What's happen—
ing to me?

Like a delicate wind, unseen, dancing on a paneled sea, light, feather
light — thus sleep dances on me.

He does not close my eyes, he leaves my soul awake. Light is he, truly,
feather light!

He persuades me, I don't know how. He pats me on the inside with ﬂat—
tering hand, he conquers me. Yes, he conquers me until my soul stretches
out —

— how she grows long and weary, my strange soul! Did a seventh day's
evening come to her precisely at noon? Did she wander blissfully too long
already between good and ripe things?

223

Thus S polee Zara thustra



She stretches herself out, long — longer! She lies still, my strange
soul. She's already tasted too much that is good, this golden melancholy
oppresses her, she grimaces.

— Like a ship that sailed into its stillest bay — now it leans against the
earth, weary of the long journeys and the uncertain seas. Is the earth not
more faithful?

How such a ship moors and nestles itself to the land — now it's enough
for a spider to spin a web to it from the land. It needs no stronger lines now.

Like such a weary ship in the stillest bay, thus I too rest now close
to the earth, faithfully, trusting, waiting, bound to it with the lightest
threads.

Oh happiness, oh happiness! Do you want to sing, oh my soul? You lie
in the grass. But this is the secret solemn hour when no shepherd plays
his ﬂute.

Stand back! Hot noon sleeps on the meadows. Do not sing! Still! The
world is perfect.

Do not sing, you winged bug in the grass, oh my soul! Do not even
whisper! Look here — still! Old noon is sleeping, he's moving his mouth:
didn't he just drink a drop of happiness —

— an old brown drop of golden happiness, golden wine? It ﬂits over him,
his happiness is laughing. Thus laughs — a god. Still! —

— “Happily, how little sufﬁces for happiness!” Thus I spoke once, and
deemed myself clever. But it was a blasphemy: this I learned now. Clever
fools speak better.

Precisely the least, the softest, the lightest, a lizard's rustling, a breath,
a wink, a blink of an eye — a little is the stuff of the hest happiness. Still!

— What happened to me: listen! Didn't time just ﬂy away? Am I not
falling? Did I not fall — listen! — into the well of eternity?

— What's happening to me? Still! Something is stinging me — oh no —
in the heart? In the heart? Oh break, break, heart, after such happiness,
after such a sting!

— What? Did the world not become perfect just now? Round and ripe?
Oh the golden round ring — where is it ﬂying to now? I'll run after it!
Rush!

Still — (and here Zarathustra stretched and felt that he was sleeping).

“Get up!” he said to himself, “you sleeper! You noon sleeper! Well then,
well now, you old legs! It's time and overtime, many a good piece of road
is still waiting for you —

224

Fourth auol Final Part



Now you've slept yourself out, for how long? Half an eternity! Well
then, well now, my old heart! How long after such a sleep will it take you
to wake yourself out?

(But then he fell asleep anew, and his soul spoke against him and resisted
and laid itself down again) — “Let me be! Still! Didn't the world become
perfect just now? Oh the golden round ball!” —

“Get up,” spoke Zarathustra, “you little thief, you loaﬁng thief! What?
Still stretching, yawning, sighing, falling down into deep wells?

Who are you? Oh my soul!” (and here he started, because a sunbeam
fell down from the sky onto his face)

“Oh sky above me,” he said, sighing, and sat upright. “You're looking
at me? You're listening to my strange soul?

When will you drink this drop of dew that has fallen upon all earthly
things — when will you drink this strange soul — when, well of eternity!
You cheerful, dreadful noon abyss! When will you drink my soul back
into yourself?”

Thus spoke Zarathustra and he rose from his sleeping place at the tree
as if from a strange drunkenness; and behold, the sun was still stand—
ing straight over his head. But from this one might justiﬁably infer that
Zarathustra had not slept long.

The Welcome

It was not until late afternoon that Zarathustra returned home to his
cave after much searching and roaming around in vain. But as he stood
facing the cave, not more than twenty paces away from it, something
happened that he least expected now: once again he heard the great try of
distress. And, amazingly, this time it came from his own cave! But it was a
protracted, manifold, peculiar cry, and Zarathustra clearly differentiated
that it was composed of many voices; even if, heard from a distance, it
sounded like the cry of a single mouth.

Then Zarathustra bounded toward his cave, and behold, what an eyeful
awaited him after this earful! Indeed, there sitting all together were the
ones he had passed by during the day: the king on the right and king on
the left, the old magician, the pope, the voluntary beggar, the shadow, the
conscientious of spirit, the sad soothsayer and the ass; the ugliest human
being, however, had donned a crown and draped two purple sashes around

225

Thus S polee Zara thustra



himself — for like all ugly people he loved to disguise himself and act
beautiful. But in the midst of this gloomy company stood Zarathustra's
eagle, bristling and restless because he was pressed to answer too much for
which his pride had no answer; meanwhile the wise snake hung around
his neck.

All of this Zarathustra observed with great amazement; then he exam—
ined each one of his guests with affable curiosity, read their souls and
was amazed once more. In the meantime the assembled had risen from
their seats and they waited respectfully for Zarathustra to speak. But
Zarathustra spoke thus:

“You despairing ones! You strange ones! So it was your cry of distress
I heard? And now I also know where to ﬁnd the one whom I have sought
in vain today: the higher mah — :

— in my own cave he's sitting, the higher man! But why am I amazed?
Did I myself not lure him to me with honey sacriﬁces and the cunning
calls of my happiness?

Yet it seems to me you are not ﬁt company for each other; sitting
here together you strain each other's nerves, you criers of distress. First
someone has to come,

— someone to make you laugh again, a good gay buffoon, a dancer and
a wind and wildcat, some old fool — what do you think?

Forgive me please, you despairing ones, for speaking to you with such
small words, unworthy, truly, of such guests! But you cannot guess what
makes my heart so mischievous —

You yourselves are responsible, and how you look, forgive me! After
all, everyone who looks at a despairing person becomes mischievous. To
give encouragement to someone who despairs — for that everyone thinks
they're strong enough.

You yourselves gave me this strength — a good gift, my elevated guests!
A righteous gift for your host! Well then, don't be angry now when I offer
you something of my own.

This here is my kingdom and my dominion; but whatever is mine shall
be yours for this evening and this night. My animals shall serve you; my
cave shall be your resting place!

In my home and house no one shall despair; in my territory I protect
everyone from his wild animals. And that is the ﬁrst thing I offer you:
security!

226

Fourth auol Final Part



But the second thing is: my little ﬁnger. And once you've got hold of
it, just go ahead and take the whole hand! And my heart too! Welcome to
this place, welcome, my guests! ”

Thus spoke Zarathustra and he laughed with love and malice. After
this welcome his guests bowed repeatedly and maintained a respectful
silence; then the king on the right responded in their name.

“By the manner, oh Zarathustra, that you offered us your hand and
your greeting, we recognize you as Zarathustra. You humbled yourself
before us; you almost offended our sense of respect —

— but who is able to humble himself like you with such pride? That in
itself uplifts us, it refreshes our eyes and hearts.

To behold this alone we would have gladly climbed higher mountains
than this one here. We came hungry for something to behold, we wanted
to see what brightens gloomy eyes.

And behold, already we have ceased all our crying of distress. Already
our minds and hearts stand open and are delighted. Little is missing and
our spirits will become spirited.

Nothing more delightful grows on earth, oh Zarathustra, than a tall,
strong will: that is the earth's most beautiful plant. An entire landscape
is invigorated by one such tree.

Whoever grows tall like you, oh Zarathustra, I compare to the stone—
pine: long, silent, hard, solitary, of the most resilient wood, magni—
ﬁcent —

— but in the end reaching out with strong green branches for its domin—
ion, asking strong questions before the winds and weather and whatever
else is at home in the heights,

— answering even more strongly, a commander, a Victor: oh who would
not climb high mountains to look upon such plants?

Even the gloomy, the failures are invigorated by your tree, oh Zarathus—
tra, even the hearts of the unsteady are made sure and are healed at the
sight of you.

And truly, many eyes today are trained on your mountain and tree;
a great longing has opened up, and many have learned to ask: who is
Zarathustra?

And those into whose ears you ever dripped your song and your honey:
all the hidden ones, the solitary and the dualitary, said at once to their
hearts:

227

Thus S polee Zara thustra



‘Does Zarathustra still live? It's not worth it anymore to live, all is the
same, all is in vain: or — we must live with Zarathustra!'

‘Why does he not come, he who announced himself for so long?' thus
many ask. ‘Did solitude swallow him up? Or should we perhaps go to
him?'

Now it happens that solitude itself is becoming brittle and is breaking
apart, like a grave that breaks open and can no longer contain its dead.
Everywhere one sees the resurrected.

Now the waves rise and rise around your mountain, oh Zarathustra.
And as high as your height may be, many must go up to you; your skiff
shall not be on the rocks much longer.

And that we who despair have now come to your cave and no longer
despair: this is merely a token and an omen that better ones are on their
way to you —

— for what is on its way to you is nothing less than the last remnant of
God among human beings, that is: all human beings of great longing, of
great nausea, of great surfeit,

— all who do not want to live unless they once again learn to hope —
unless they learn from you, oh Zarathustra, the great hope!”

Thus spoke the king on the right and he grasped Zarathustra's hand in
order to kiss it; but Zarathustra rebuffed his veneration and stepped back
startled, silent, and as if he were ﬂeeing suddenly into remote distances.
But after a brief while he was once again among his guests, looking at
them with bright, piercing eyes, and he said:

“My guests, you higher men, I want to speak in German and in—
telligibly with you. Not for you did I wait here in these mountains.

(‘In German and intelligibly? May God have mercy!' said the king on
the left, as an aside. ‘One notices that he does not know our dear Germans,
this wise man from the East!

But he really means “in German and in—eptly” — well then! Nowadays
that is not the worst of tastes!')

“You may indeed be higher men, collectively,” Zarathustra continued.
“But for me — you are not high and strong enough.

For me, that is: for the inexorable that remains silent in me but will not
always remain silent. And if you belong to me, then surely not as my right
arm.

For whoever stands on sick and frail legs himself, as you do, wants
above all to be spareol, whether he knows it or conceals it from himself.

But I do not spare my arms and legs, I do not spare my warriors: how
could you be ﬁt for my war?

With you I would only ruin every victory. And many of you would
already fall over just to hear the loud pounding of my drums.

Nor are you beautiful enough for me and wellborn. I need clean,
smooth mirrors for my teachings; on your surfaces even my own image is
distorted.

Your shoulders are weighed down by many a burden, many a memory;
in your corners many a wicked dwarf crouches. There is hidden rabble in
you as well.

And even if you are higher and of a higher kind: much in you is crooked
and deformed. There's no smith in the world who could hammer you right
and straight for me.

You are mere bridges — may higher people stride across on you! You
represent steps — so do not be angered by the one who steps over you into
his height!

From your seed perhaps a genuine son and perfect heir will grow some—
day for me; but that is far off. You yourselves are not the ones to whom
my inheritance and my name belong.

Not for you do I wait here in these mountains, not with you shall I go
down for the last time. You came to me only as an omen that higher ones
are on their way to me —

— hot the people of great longing, of great nausea, of great surfeit and
that which you called the remnant of God.

— No! No! Three times no! I wait for others here in these mountains
and will not lift a foot from here without them,

— for higher, stronger, more victorious, more cheerful ones, those who
are built right—angled in body and soul: laughing lious must come!

Oh my guests, you strange ones — have you not yet heard anything of
my children? And that they are on their way to me?

Speak to me of my gardens, of my blessed isles, of my beautiful new
species2 — why don't you speak to me of that?

This host's gift I beg of your love, that you speak of my children. It is
for this that I am rich, for this that I became poor: what did I not give,

2 Kaufmann in his translation deleted the word “species” (Art), writing instead: “Speak to me of
my gardens, of my blessed isles, of my new beauty” Nietzsche referred to the overman as a new
species, even while he insisted that the current human being cannot be “leaped over” in the pursuit
of the overman:

229

Thus S polee Zara thustra



— what would I not give just to have this one thing: these children, this
living plantation, these life—trees of my will and my highest hope!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra and suddenly he stopped in his speech, because
his longing overcame him, and his eyes and his mouth were closed by the
turmoil in his heart. And all his guests were silent as well, and they stood
still and dismayed; except that the old soothsayer made signs and gestures
with his hands.

The Last Supper

At this point, however, the soothsayer interrupted the welcome of
Zarathustra and his guests; he pushed forward like someone who has no
time to lose, grabbed Zarathustra's hand and shouted: “But Zarathustra!

One thing is more needful than the other, so you yourselfsay: well then,
one thing is more needful to me now than everything else.

A word at the right time: did you not invite me to supper? And here are
many who traveled a long way. Surely you do not intend to feed us with
speeches?

Also, you have all given too much thought already to freezing, drowning,
suffocating and other bodily emergencies: but no one has thought about
my emergency, namely starving 7”

(Thus spoke the soothsayer; but when Zarathustra's animals heard
these words, they ran away terriﬁed, seeing that whatever they had brought
home by day would not sufﬁce to stuff even this one soothsayer.)

“Including dying of thirst,” continued the soothsayer. “And even
though I hear water splashing here, like the speeches of wisdom, namely
abundantly and tirelessly, I want — wiue!

Not everyone is a born water drinker, like Zarathustra. Nor is water ﬁt
for the weary and the wilted: we deserve wine — only it provides sudden
convalescence and instant health!”

At this opportunity, since the soothsayer demanded wine, it happened
that the king on the left, the silent one, also spoke up at last. “We have
taken care of the wine,” he said, “I together with my brother, the king on
the right: we have wine enough — an entire ass—load. So nothing is lacking
but bread.”

“Bread?” countered Zarathustra, and he laughed. “Bread is the one
thing hermits do not have. But man does not live by bread alone, but also
on the meat of good lambs, of which I have two:

230

Fourth auol Final Part



— These we'll quickly slaughter and spice with sage; that's how I love it.
And we do not lack for roots and fruits, good enough even for sweet—tooths
and big eaters; nor for nuts and other riddles to crack.

And so we'll make a good meal in short order. But whoever wants to
share in the eating must also lend a hand, even the kings. In Zarathustra's
home, even a king may be a cook.”

This suggestion appealed to the hearts of everyone, except that the
voluntary beggar objected to meat and wine and spices.

“Just listen to this glutton Zarathustra!” he said jokingly. “Is that why
people go into caves and high mountains, to prepare such meals?

Now indeed I understand what he once taught us: ‘Praised be a small
poverty!' And why he wants to get rid of beggars.”

“Cheer up,” answered Zarathustra, “as I am cheered. Stick to your
custom, you excellent man, crunch your grains, drink your water, praise
your cuisine — if only it makes you cheerful!

I am a law only for my own, I am no law for everyone. But whoever
belongs to me must be of strong bones, also light of foot —

— must be eager for wars and festivals, no gloomy Gus, no dreamy Joe,
just as ready for what is hardest as for his festival, healthy and hale.

What's best belongs to mine and to me; if one doesn't give it to us,
then we take it — the best food, the clearest sky, the strongest thoughts,
the most beautiful women!” —

Thus spoke Zarathustra; but the king on the right retorted: “That's
odd! Did anyone ever hear such clever things from the mouth of a wise
man?

And truly, the oddest thing about a wise man is when, on top of every—
thing else, he is also clever and not an ass.”

Thus spoke the king on the right and he was amazed; but the ass
responded to his remarks malevolently with “hee—yaw.” And this was the
beginning of that long meal which is called “the last supper” in the history
books. During the same, however, nothing was discussed but the higher
man.

011 the Higher Matt
1

When I came to mankind for the ﬁrst time, I committed the hermit's folly,
the great folly: I situated myself in the market place.

231

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And when I spoke to all, I spoke to none. But by evening my com—
panions were tightrope walkers, and corpses, and I myself almost a
corpse.

But with the new morning a new truth came to me; then I learned to
say: “What do the market place and the rabble and the rabble noise and
long rabble ears matter to me!”

You higher men, learn this from me: in the market place no one believes
in higher men. And if you want to speak there, well then! But the rabble
blinks “we are all equal.

You higher men” — thus blinks the rabble — “there are no higher men,
we are all equal, human is human, before God — we are all equal!”

Before God! — Now, however, this God has died. But we do not want
to be equal before the rabble. You higher men, go away from the market
place!

2

Before God! — But now this god has died! You higher men, this god was
your greatest danger.

It is only now, since he lies in his grave, that you are resurrected.
Only now the great noon comes, only now the higher man becomes —
ruler!3

Have you understood these words, oh my brothers? You are frightened;
do your hearts become dizzy? Does the abyss yawn before you here? Does
the hell hound yelp before you here?

Well then! Well now! You higher men! Only now is the mountain in
labor with humanity's future. God died: now we want — the overman to
live.

3

Those who care most today ask: “How are human beings to be preserved?”
But Zarathustra is the only one and the ﬁrst one to ask: “How shall human
being be overcome?”

3 Neither “lord” nor “master” ﬁts here for Herr, “ruler.” See “On the Three Evils” where Nietzsche
defends Herrschsucht, “lust to rule,” a noun based on herrschert, “to rule,” which in turn is based
on Herr, ruler: Nietzsche‘s motif for TSZ Part IV is “who shall be ruler of the earth.” The earth
can neither be “lorded” nor “mastered,” but according to Nietzsche, it shall be ruled:

232

Fourth auol Final Part



The overman is in my heart, that is my ﬁrst and my only concern —
and not human beings; not the neighbor, not the poorest, not the most
suffering, not the best —

Oh my brothers, what I am able to love in human beings is that they
are a going over and a going under. And in you, too, there is much that
makes me love and hope.

That you despise, you higher men, that makes me hope. For the great
despisers are the great reverers.

That you have despaired, there is much to revere in that. For you did
not learn how to surrender, you did not learn petty prudence.

For today the little people have become ruler: they all preach surrender
and resignation and prudence and industry and consideration and the long
etcetera of little Virtues.

What is effeminate, what comes from the servant's ilk and especially
the rabble mishmash: that now wants to become ruler of all human destiny
— oh nausea! Nausea! Nausea!

That asks and asks and does not tire: “How do human beings preserve
themselves best, longest, most pleasantly?” With that — they are the rulers
of today.

Overcome these rulers of today for me, oh my brothers — these little
people: they are the overman's greatest danger!

Overcome for me, you higher men, the little virtues, the little pru—
dence, the sand—grain sized considerations, the detritus of swarm—
ing ants, the pitiful contentedness, the “happiness of the greatest
number”!

And despair rather than surrender. And truly, I love you for not knowing
how to live today, you higher men! For thus you live — best!

4

Do you have courage, oh my brothers? Are you brave of heart? Not courage
before witnesses, but the courage of hermits and eagles, which not even a
god looks at anymore.

Cold souls, mules, the blind, the drunk — these I do not call brave of
heart. Whoever has heart knows fear, but eohquersfear; sees the abyss, but
With priole.

Whoever sees the abyss, but with eagle's eyes, whoever grasps the abyss
with eagle's talons: he has courage. —

5

“Human beings are evil” — thus spoke all the wisest to comfort me. Oh, if
only it were still true today! Because evil is a human being's best power.

“Mankind must become better and more evil” — thus I teach. What is
most evil is necessary for the overman's best.

It may have been good for that preacher of the little people that he
suffered and labored under the sins of mankind. But I enjoy the greatest
sin as my greatest comfort. —

But such things are not said for long ears. Every word does not belong
in every snout. These are ﬁne and faraway things: sheeps' hooves should
not reach for them!

6

You higher men, do you think I am here to make good what you made
bad?

Or that I have come henceforth to bed you suffering ones more
comfortably? Or to show new, easier paths to those of you who are unsteady,
lost, and have climbed astray?

No! No! Three times no! Ever more, ever better of your kind shall
perish — for you shall have it ever worse and ever harder. Only thus —

— only thus do human beings grow into that height, where lightning
strikes and breaks them: high enough for lightning!

My mind and my longing are trained on the few, the long, the distant:
what do I care about your many little brief miseries?

You do not suffer enough in my opinion! For you suffer from yourselves,
you haven't yet suffered from human heiugs. And you would be lying if you
said otherwise! All of you do not suffer from what I suffered. —

7

It is not enough for me that lightning no longer causes damage. I do not
want to divert it: it shall learn to work — for me.

My wisdom has gathered itself for a long time like a cloud, it becomes
stiller and darker. Thus does every wisdom that shall one day give birth
to lightning.

234

Fourth auol Final Part



To these people of today I do not want to be light, nor be called light.
Them — I want to blind: lightning of my wisdom — put out their eyes!

8

Will nothing beyond your capacity: there is a wicked falseness among
those who will beyond their capacity.

Especially when they will great things! For they arouse mistrust against
great things, these ﬁne counterfeiters and actors —

— until at last they are false before themselves, cross—eyed, white—washed
worm food, cloaked by strong words, by showy virtues, by gleaming false
works.

Be very careful there, you higher men! For I regard nothing more
precious and rare today than honesty.

Is this today not of the rabble? But rabble does not know what is great,
what is small, what is straight and honest: it is innocently crooked, it
always lies.

9

Have a good mistrust today, you higher men, you brave—hearted, you
open—hearted ones! And keep your grounds secret! For this today is of
the rabble.

What the rabble once learned to believe without grounds, how could
anyone overthrow that with grounds?

In the market place one convinces with gestures. But grounds make
the rabble mistrustful.

And if ever truth was victorious there, then ask yourselves with good
mistrust: “Which strong error fought for it?”

And beware also of the scholars! They hate you, because they are
sterile! They have cold, dried up eyes; before them every bird lies
plucked.

Such types boast that they do not lie: but powerlessness to lie is by no
means love for the truth. Beware!

Freedom from fever is by no means knowledge! I do not believe spirits
that have cooled down. Whoever cannot lie does not know what truth
is.

10

If you want to climb high and beyond, then use your own legs! Do not let
yourselves be earrieol up, do not seat yourselves on strangers' backs and
heads!

But you mount your horse? You ride swiftly up to your goal? Well then,
my friend! But your lame foot is also mounted on your horse!

When you've reached your goal, when you leap from your horse, pre—
cisely at your height, you higher man — you will stumble!

11

You creators, you higher men! One is pregnant only with one's own child.

Do not let yourselves be misled and spoon—fed! Who after all is your
neighbor? And even if you act “for your neighbor” — still you don't create
for him!

Unlearn this “for,” you creators; your virtue itself wants that you do
nothing “for” and “in order” and “because.” You should plug your ears
against these false little words.

“For your neighbor” is the virtue of only small people; there they say
“birds of a feather” and “one hand washes the other” — they have neither
the right nor the strength to your self—interest.

In your self—interest, you creators, are the precaution and providence
of the pregnant! What no one yet has laid eyes on, the fruit: your whole
love shelters and spares and nourishes it.

Where your whole love is, with your children, there too your whole
virtue is! Your work, your will is your “neighbor” — do not let yourself be
spoon—fed any false values!

12

You creators, you higher men! Whoever must give birth is sick; but who—
ever has given birth, is unclean.

Ask women: one does not give birth because it is enjoyable. Pain makes
hens and poets cackle.

You creators, in you there is much that is unclean. That's because you
had to be mothers.

236

Fourth auol Final Part



A new child — oh how much new ﬁlth also came into the world! Step
aside! And whoever has given birth should wash his soul clean!

I3

Do not be Virtuous beyond your strengths! And will nothing of yourselves
that is contrary to probability!

Walk in the footsteps where your fathers' virtue walked before!
How could you climb high if your fathers' will did not climb with
you?

But whoever would be a ﬁrstling should see to it that he does not also
become a lastling! And where the vices of your fathers are, there you
should not pretend to be saints!

If your fathers took to women and strong wine and boar swine, what
would be the use of demanding chastity of yourself?

It would be a folly! To me it truly seems like much if such a man
belonged to one or two or three women.

And if he founded monasteries and wrote above the door: “This way
to sainthood” — I would still say: What for! It's a new folly!

He founded himself a guardhouse and safeguard: good for him! But I
don't believe in it.

Whatever one brings into solitude grows in it, even the inner beast. On
this score, solitude is ill—advised for many.

Was there ever anything ﬁlthier on earth than saints of the wilderness?
Arouuol them not only hell broke loose — but pigs too.

14

Timid, ashamed, awkward, like a tiger whose leap has failed; thus, you
higher men, I often saw you slinking aside. A throw failed you.

But what does it matter, you dice throwers! You did not learn to gamble
and banter as one should gamble and banter! Are we not always sitting at
a great bantering and gaming table?

And when something great failed you, are you yourselves therefore —
failures? And if you yourselves failed, did humanity therefore fail? But if
humanity failed: well then, well now!

237

Thus S polee Zara thustra



15

The higher its kind, the more seldom a thing succeeds. You higher men
here, haven't all of you — failed?

Be of good cheer, what does it matter! How much is still possible! Learn
to laugh at yourselves as one must laugh!

And no wonder that you failed and half succeeded, you half—broken
ones! Does humanity'sfuture not push and shove within you?

What is most distant, deepest, highest to the stars in humanity, its
prodigious power: does all that not foam against each other in your pot?

No wonder many a pot breaks! Learn to laugh at yourselves as one must
laugh! You higher men, oh how much is still possible!

And truly, how much has succeeded already! How rich is this earth in
small, good, perfect things, in things that turned out well!

Place small, good, perfect things around you, you higher men! Their
golden ripeness heals the heart. Perfection teaches us to hope.

16

What was the greatest sin here on earth until now? Was it not the words
of him who spoke: “Woe to you who laugh now!”

Did he himself ﬁnd no reasons to laugh on earth? Then he searched
badly. Even a child ﬁnds reasons here.

He — did not love enough; or else he would have loved us too, we who
laugh! But he hated and heckled us, howling and gnashing of teeth he
heralded for us.

Must one curse right away where one does not love? That — seems to
me in bad taste. But that is how he acted, this unconditional one. He came
from the rabble.

And he himself just did not love enough; or else he would have been
less angry that people did not love him. All great love does not want love
— it wants more.

Get out of the way of all such unconditional ones! That is a poor sick
kind, a rabble kind; they look harshly at this life, they have the evil eye for
this earth.

Get out of the way of all such unconditional ones! They have heavy
feet and sultry hearts — they do not know how to dance. How could the
earth be light to them?

238

Fourth auol Final Part



I7

Crookedly all good things approach their goal. Like cats they arch their
backs, they purr inwardly with their impending happiness — all good
things laugh.

A person's stride betrays whether one is striding on his course: just
look at me walk! But whoever approaches his goal dances.

And truly, I have not become a statue, I do not yet stand there stiff,
stunned, stony, a column; I love swift running.

And even though there are bogs and thick depressions on earth, who—
ever has light feet runs over and past the mud and dances as if on clean—
swept ice.

Lift up your hearts, my brothers, high! higher! And don't forget your
legs either! Lift up your legs as well, you good dancers, and better still:
stand on your heads too!

18

This crown of the laughing one, this rose—wreath crown — I myself put
on this crown, I myself pronounced my laughter holy. I found no other
strong enough for it today.

Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one who waves with his
wings, the ﬂightworthy, waving to all birds, worthy and ready, a blissful
lightweight —

Zarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the soothlaugher, not impa—
tient, not unconditional, someone who loves capers and escapades; I
myself put on this crown!

19

Lift up your hearts, my brothers, high! higher! And don't forget your legs
either! Lift up your legs as well, you good dancers, and better still: stand
on your heads too!

Even in happiness there are heavy creatures, there are born ponderi—
pedes. Quaintly they struggle, like an elephant struggling to stand on its
head.

But it is better to be foolish with happiness than foolish with unhap—
piness, better to dance ponderously than to walk lamely. So learn this
wisdom from me: even the worst thing has two good reverse sides —

239

Thus S polee Zara thustra



— even the worst thing has good legs for dancing: so learn from me, you
higher men, to stand yourselves on your right legs!

So unlearn moping and all rabble sadness! Oh how sad even today's
rabble clowns seem to me! But this today is of the rabble.

20

Make like the wind when he plunges from his mountain caves: he
wants to dance to his own pipe, the seas tremble and skip under his
footsteps.

Praised be this good unruly spirit who gives wings to asses and milks
the lionesses, who comes upon all that is today and all rabble like a storm
wind —

— who is hostile to thistle—heads and hair—splitters and all wilted leaves
and weeds: praised be this good, free storm spirit, who dances on bogs
and depressions as upon meadows!

Who hates the rabble's mindless swindlers and all botched gloomy
brood: praised be this spirit of all free spirits, the laughing storm who
blows dust into the eyes of all fusspots and pus—pots!

You higher men, your worst part is that all of you have not learned to
dance as one must dance — dance over and past yourselves! What does it
matter that you didn't turn out well?

How much is still possible! So learn to laugh over and past yourselves!
Lift up your hearts, you good dancers, high! higher! And don't forget
good laughter either!

This crown of the laughing one, this rose—wreath crown: to you, my
brothers, I throw this crown! I pronounced laughter holy; you higher
men, learh — to laugh!

The Song of/l/Ielaheholy

As Zarathustra made these speeches he stood close to the entrance of his
cave; with the last words, however, he slipped away from his guests and
ﬂed for a short while into the open.

“Oh clean fragrance around me,” he cried out, “oh blissful stillness
around me! But where are my animals? Come here, come here my eagle
and my snake!

240

Fourth auol Final Part



Tell me, my animals: these higher men all together — do they perhaps
not smell good? Oh clean fragrances around me! Only now do I know and
feel how I love you, my animals.”

— And Zarathustra spoke again. “I love you, my animals!” But the eagle
and snake pressed up against him as he spoke these words, and they looked
up at him. In such a manner the three of them together snifﬂed and sipped
the good air. For the air here outside was better than among the higher
men.

2

But scarcely had Zarathustra left his cave when the old magician stood
up, looked around cunningly and said: “He's gone out!

And already, you higher men — if I may tickle you with this complimen—
tary and ﬂattering name, even as he did — already my wicked deceiving
and magic spirit befalls me, my melancholy devil,

— who is an adversary of Zarathustra from the ground up: forgive him!
Now he wants to conjure before you, right now is his hour; I wrestle in
vain with this evil spirit.

All of you, whatever honors you may give yourselves with words,
whether you call yourselves ‘the free spirits' or ‘the truthful' or
‘penitents of the spirit' or ‘the unbound' or ‘the great longing
ones' —

— all of you who suffer from the great nausea like me, for whom the old
God died and no new god is lying yet in cradles and crib clothes — all of
you are favored by my evil spirit and magic devil.

I know you, you higher men, I know him — I also know this monster
whom I love against my will, this Zarathustra: he himself often seems to
me like a beautiful mask of a saint,

— like a new wondrous masquerade in which my evil spirit, the melan—
choly devil, enjoys himself— I love Zarathustra, so it often seems to me,
for the sake of my evil spirit. —

But already he befalls me and forces me, this spirit of melancholy, this
evening twilight devil; and truly, you higher men, he is fond —

— just open your eyes! — he is fond of coming ualeeol, whether male or
female I do not yet know; but he is coming, he is forcing me, oh 110! Open
your senses!

Thus S polee Zara thustra



The day is winding down, to all things evening now is coming, even to
the best things; listen now and see, you higher men, what kind of devil,
whether man or woman, this spirit of evening melancholy is!”

Thus spoke the old magician, glanced around cunningly and then
reached for his harp.

When the air grows dim,4

When already the dew's consolation

Wells down to earth,

Invisible, and unheard 7

For delicate shoes wears

The dewy consoler, like all who mildly console 7
Do you recall then, do you recall, hot heart,
How once you thirsted,

For tears from the sky and dribbles of dew,
Parched and weary, thirsted

While on yellow grass paths

Malicious evening sun glances

Ran through black trees around you,

Blinding sun—ember glances, delighting in your pain?

“The wooer of truth? You?” 7 thus they mocked 7
“No! Mere fool!

A beast, a cunning, preying, creeping beast
That must lie,

That must knowingly, willingly lie:
Lusting for prey,

4 “Bei abgehellter Luft” means literally when the air has cleared or brightened: Nietzsche is borrow—

Jakob Schevens seinen Geburtstag” (Geolichte vort Paul Fleming, ed: Julius Tittmann (Leipzig: E A.
Brockhaus, 1870), p. 23 5). Grimms‘ Deutsches Wo'rterhuch, the authoritative dictionary of the Ger—
man language, quotes both Fleming and Nietzsche for ahhellert: However, in this context Nietzsche
appears to use the verb ahhellert to mean “dimming” or “darkening.”

More at home in any wilderness than before temples,

Full of feline mischief,

Swish! into every chance,

Snifﬁng toward every jungle,

Greedily, longingly snifﬁng,

So that in jungles

Among dappled beasts of prey

You could run, sinfully healthy and colorful and beautiful,
With lusty lips,

Blissfully mocking, blissfully hellish, blissfully bloodthirsty,
Run preying, creeping, lying 7

Or, like the eagle that long,
Long gazes ﬁxedly into abysses,
Into its own abysses 7

Oh how they wind downward here,
Down low, down into,

Into ever deeper depths! 7

You spring to ﬂight,

Pounce 011 lambs,

Lusting for lambs,

Scything away at rosy hammocks

Sink down into night, sink down, pale 7

From my own truth—madness,

From my longings of the day,

Weary of the day, sick from light,

By one truth

Burned and thirsty:

How you thirsted then? 7

To be banned

From all truth,

Mere poet!

Oh S eiehee

Thus sang the magician; and all who were together went unwittingly,
like birds, into the net of his cunning and melancholy rapture. Only the
conscientious of spirit was not captured; he snatched the harp away from
the magician and cried: “Air! Let in the good air! Let Zarathustra in! You
make this cave sultry and poisonous, you wicked old magician!

You seduce us, you faker, you ﬁne one, to unknown desires and wilder—
nesses. And watch out when such as you start making speeches and fuss
about truth!

Woe to all free spirits who are not on their guard for such magicians!
Their freedom is done for: you teach and tempt us back into prisons —

— you old melancholy devil, out of your lament rings a bird call; you
resemble those who secretly incite sexual desires with their praise of
chastity!”

Thus spoke the conscientious one; but the old magician looked around,
enjoyed his triumph, and for its sake swallowed the annoyance that the
conscientious one caused him. “Be quiet!” he said with a modest voice.
“Good songs want to reverberate well; one should remain silent for a long
time after good songs.

That is what all these do, the higher men. But you perhaps have under—
stood little of my song? In you there is little of a magic spirit.”

“You praise me,” retorted the conscientious one. “In so far as you
distinguish me from yourself, well good! But you others, what do I see
here? You're all still sitting there with lusting eyes —

You free souls, where is your freedom now? Almost, it seems to me,
you resemble those who have long watched wicked, dancing naked girls:
your very souls are dancing!

In you, you higher men, there must be more of that which the magician
calls his evil magic and deceiving spirit — we must surely be very different.

And truly, we spoke and thought enough together, before Zarathustra
came home to his cave, to let me know that we are different.

We are seeleihg something different up here too, you and I. I for one am
seeking more security, that is why I came to Zarathustra. For he is still the
most solid tower and will —

— today, when everything is wobbling, when the whole earth is quaking.
But you, when I look at the eyes that you make, it almost seems to me you
are seeking more insecurity,

245

Thus S polee Zara thustra



— more thrills, more danger, more earthquakes. What you are fond of,
I almost suppose, but forgive my posing, you higher men —

— what you are fond of is the worst, most dangerous life, the one that
frightens me the most; the life of wild animals, woods, caves, steep moun—
tains and labyrinthine gorges.

And not the leaders away from danger do you like best, but instead those
who lead you astray from all paths, the seducers. But, if such fondness is
real in you, then it seems to me impossihle nonetheless.

Fear, after all — that is a human being's original and basic feeling; from
fear everything can be explained, original sin and original virtue. From
fear my virtue also grew, it is called: science.

For the fear of wild animals — it was bred longest in human beings,
including the animal that he conceals within himself and fears — Zarathus—
tra calls it ‘the inner beast.'

Such a long old fear, reﬁned at last, made spiritual, intellectual — today,
it seems to me, it is called: seieuee.” —

Thus spoke the conscientious one; but Zarathustra, who had just
returned to his cave and heard and guessed the last speech, tossed a
hand full of roses to the conscientious one and laughed at his “truths.”
“What!” he cried. “What did I hear just now? Truly, it seems to me, you
are a fool or I myself am one; and your ‘truth' I stand wham—bam on its
head.

Fearyou see — is our exception. But courage and adventure and pleasure
in uncertainty, in what is undared — courage seems to me humanity's whole
prehistory.

He envied and robbed the wildest, most courageous animals of all their
virtues: only thus did he become — human.

This courage, reﬁned at last, made spiritual, intellectual, this human
courage with eagle's wings and snake's cleverness: it, it seems to me, today
is called — ”

“Zarathustra!” cried everyone sitting together, as if with one mouth,
and they raised a great laughter then, and it rose from them like a heavy
cloud. Even the magician laughed and said cleverly: “Well then, he's gone,
my evil spirit!

And did I myself not warn you about him when I said that he was a
deceiver and a cheat— and deceit spirit?

Especially, you see, when he shows himself naked. But what can I do
about his tricks! Did I create him and the world?

246

Well then! Let's be good again and be cheerful! And even though
Zarathustra looks angry — just look at him, he grudges me —

— before night comes he will learn again to love and laud me, he cannot
live long without committing such follies.

He — loves his enemies: this art he understands best of all whom I have
seen. But he takes revenge for it — on his friends!”

Thus spoke the old magician, and the higher men applauded him, such
that Zarathustra went around and shook the hands of his friends with
malice and love — like someone who has to make up for something and
apologize to everyone. But when in doing so he reached the door of his
cave, then once again he had a craving for the good air outside and for his
animals — and he wanted to slip out.

Among Daughters of the Desert
1

“Do not go away!” said the wanderer who called himself the shadow of
Zarathustra. “Stay with us, or else our old dull depression could befall us
again.

Already that old magician has regaled us with his worst, and just look,
the good pious pope there has tears in his eyes and once again he's com—
pletely shipped out on the sea of melancholy.

These kings may well put on a good face before us; of all of us today
they learned that best after all! But if they did not have witnesses, I bet
that the evil game would begin again with them too —

— the evil game of drifting clouds, of damp melancholy, of veiled skies,
of stolen suns, of howling autumn winds,

— the evil game of our howling and crying in distress; stay with us, oh
Zarathustra! Here there is much hidden misery that wants to speak, much
evening, much cloud, much musty air!

You nourished us with strong, manly fare and strong sayings: do not
permit the wimpy womanish spirits to befall us again for dessert!

You alone make the air around you strong and clear! Have I ever on
earth found such good air as here with you in your cave?

Many lands indeed have I seen, my nose learned to test and assess
many kinds of air; but in your cave my nostrils taste their greatest
treat!

247

Thus S polee Zara thustra



Unless — unless — oh forgive an old memory! Forgive me an old dessert
song that I once composed among daughters of the desert —

— for among them there was likewise good, bright, oriental air; there I
was furthest from cloudy, damp, melancholy old Europe!

Back then I loved such Oriental girls and a different blue sky, over
which no clouds and no thoughts hang.

You wouldn't believe how decently they sat there when they weren't
dancing; deep, but without thoughts, like little secrets, like beribboned
riddles, like dessert nuts —

colorful and foreign to be sure! but without clouds; riddles that can be
guessed: as a favor to such girls I then thought up a dessert psalm.”

Thus spoke the wanderer and shadow; and before anyone answered
him, he had already grasped the old magician's harp, crossed his legs and
looked around digniﬁed and wisely; but with his nostrils he slowly and
questioningly inhaled the air like someone in new lands who savors the
new, strange air. Then he began to sing with a kind of roaring voice.

The Awaleehihg
1

After the song of the wanderer and shadow all at once the cave became
full of noise and laughter; and because the assembled guests all spoke
at the same time, and even the ass no longer kept quiet amidst such
encouragement, Zarathustra was overcome by a slight aversion and a bit
of scorn for his Visitors, even though he was glad for their cheerfulness.
This, it seemed to him, was a sign of their convalescence. And so he
slipped out into the open and spoke to his animals.

“Where is their distress now?” he said, and already he himself was
relieved of his minor annoyance. “In my company, it seems to me, they
have unlearned their crying in distress!

— Though unfortunately, not their crying.” And Zarathustra covered
his ears, for just then the hee—yaw of the ass blended oddly with the noisy
jubilation of these higher men.

“They're having fun,” he began again, “and who knows? Perhaps at
the expense of their host; and if they learned to laugh from me, then still
it is not my laughing that they learned.

But what does it matter? They're old people; they convalesce in their
way, they laugh in their way: my ears have endured worse already without
becoming testy.

This day is a triumph; he is already retreating, he's ﬂeeing, the spirit
of gravity, my old arch—enemy! How well this day wants to end, which
began so badly and so hard!

And it wants to end. Already evening is coming; over the sea he rides,
this good rider! How he sways, the blissful, homecoming one, in his purple
saddle!

252

Fourth auol Final Part



The sky looks on clearly, the world lies deep; oh all you strange people
who came to me, it's worth it indeed to live with me!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra. And again the cries and laughter of the higher
men came from the cave, so he began again.

“They are biting, my bait is working, their enemy is retreating from
them too, the spirit of gravity. Already they're learning to laugh at
themselves: do I hear correctly?

My manly fare is working, my Vim and vigor sayings; and truly, I did not
nourish them with gassy vegetables! But with warrior fare, with conqueror
fare — I awakened new desires in them.

New hopes live in their arms and legs, their hearts expand. They are
ﬁnding new words, soon their spirit will breathe mischief.

Such fare may not be for children, to be sure, nor for longing lit—
tle women, old and young; their entrails are persuaded differently, their
physician and teacher I am not.

Nausea retreats from these higher men — well then! That is my Victory.
In my kingdom they're becoming secure, all their stupid shame runs away,
they're pouring themselves out.

They're pouring out their hearts, good hours are returning to them,
they celebrate and ruminate — they're becoming gra teful.

That I take as the best sign; they're becoming grateful. It won't be long
now and they will invent festivals and erect monuments to their old joys.5

They are eohualeseihg!” Thus spoke Zarathustra gaily to his heart and
he gazed outward; but his animals pressed up against him and honored
his happiness and his silence.

2

Suddenly, however, Zarathustra's ears were startled; for the cave which
up till now had been full of noise and laughter became deathly still all at
once — but his nose sensed an aromatic smoke and incense, as of burning
pine cones.

“What is happening? What are they doing?” he asked himself and crept
closer to the entrance, in order to watch his guests surreptitiously. But,
wonder of wonders! What did he have to behold with his own eyes?

“They've all gone pious again, they're praying, they're mad!” — he said
and he was amazed beyond measure. And, in truth, all these higher men,
the two kings, the retired pope, the wicked magician, the voluntary beggar,
the wanderer and his shadow, the old soothsayer, the conscientious of
spirit and the ugliest human being — they all kneeled there like children
and devout little old women, and they worshiped the ass. And just then
the ugliest human being began to gurgle and snort as though something
unspeakable wanted to get out of him; but when he actually put it into
words, behold, it was a pious, remarkable litany praising the worshiped
and censed ass. This litany, however, sounded thus:

Amen! And praise and honor and wisdom and thanks and glory and
strength be to our god, from everlasting to everlasting!

— But to this the ass brayed Hee—yaw.

He carries our burden, he adopted the form of a servant, he is patient
from the heart and never says No; and whoever loves his god, chastises
him.

— But to this the ass brayed Hee—yaw.

He does not speak, unless it be to say Yaw to the world that he created;
thus he praises his world. It is his slyness that does not speak; this way he
is rarely found to be wrong.

— But to this the ass brayed Hee—yaw.

Homely he walks through the world. Gray is the body color in which
he cloaks his virtue. If he has spirit, then he conceals it; but everyone
believes in his long ears.

— But to this the ass brayed Hee—yaw.

What hidden wisdom is it, that he has long ears and always says Yaw
and never No! Has he not created the world in his image, namely as stupid
as possible?

— But to this the ass brayed Hee—yaw.

You walk ways that are straight and crooked; it matters little to you what
seems straight or crooked to us human beings. Your kingdom is beyond
good and evil. It is your innocence not to know what innocence is.

— But to this the ass brayed Hee—yaw.

See now, how you push no one away, not the beggars, not the kings.
The little children you let come to you, and when the mean boys bait you,
then you simplemindedly say Hee—yaw.

— But to this the ass brayed Hee—yaw.

254

Fourth auol Final Part



You love she—asses and fresh ﬁgs, you are no picky eater. A thistle tickles
your heart if you happen to be hungry. Therein lies the wisdom of a god.
— But to this the ass brayed Hee—yaw.

The Ass Festival
1

At this point in the litany, however, Zarathustra could no longer control
himself, cried Hee—yaw himself even louder than the ass, and leaped into
the midst of his guests, who had gone mad. “But what are you doing, you
mortal children?” he cried, as he pulled the praying men off the ﬂoor and
to their feet. “Watch out that someone other than Zarathustra should see
you:

Anyone would conclude that with your new faith you were the most
Vicious blasphemers or the most foolish of all old little women!

And you yourself, you old pope, how can you reconcile for yourself that
you worship this ass here as God?” —

“Oh Zarathustra,” responded the pope, “forgive me, but in matters of
God I am more enlightened even than you. And that's how it should be.

Better to worship God in this form, than in no form at all! Think
about this dictum, my exalted friend; you will quickly realize that there
is wisdom in such a dictum.

He who said ‘God is a spirit' — he took the biggest step and leap ever
on earth toward disbelief: such words are not easy to rectify on earth!

My old heart leaps and skips at the fact that there is still something to
worship on earth. Forgive, oh Zarathustra, an old pious pope's heart! 7”

— “And you,” said Zarathustra to the wanderer and shadow, “you call
and consider yourself a free spirit? And yet here you perform such idolatry
and popery?

Your performance here is more wicked indeed than it is with your
wicked brown girls, you wicked new believer!”

“Wicked enough,” answered the wanderer and shadow, “you're right;
but what can I do about it? The old God lives again, oh Zarathustra, say
What you Will.

The ugliest human being is to blame for everything; he has awakened
him again. And when he says that he once killed him: death is always a
mere prejudice among gods.”

255

Thus S polee Zara thustra



— “And you,” said Zarathustra, “you wicked old magician, what have
you done! Who in these liberated times is supposed to believe in you
anymore, if you believe in such asinine divinities?

What you did was a stupidity; how could you, you clever one, commit
such a stupidity!”

“Oh Zarathustra,” replied the clever magician, “you're right, it was a
stupidity — and it's been hard enough for me.”

— “And you most of all,” said Zarathustra to the conscientious of spirit,
“lean your head on your hand and consider! Doesn't anything here go
against your conscience? Isn't your spirit too clean for this praying and
the steam of these Holy Joes?”

“There is something about it,” answered the conscientious one, leaning
his head on his hand, “there is something about this spectacle that actually
does my spirit good.

Maybe because I am not allowed to believe in God; but it is certain that
God in this form seems most believable to me.

God should be eternal, according to the witnessing of the most pious;
whoever has that much time, takes his time. As slowly and as stupidly as
possible: that way such a one can indeed go very far.

And whoever has too much spirit, he may well become a fool even for
stupidity and folly. Think about your own case, oh Zarathustra!

You yourself— indeed! Even you could well become an ass from super—
abundance and wisdom.

Does a perfectly wise man not like to walk on crooked paths? Appear—
ances would indicate this, oh Zarathustra — your appearance!”

— “And ﬁnally you yourself,” said Zarathustra and he turned toward the
ugliest human being, who still lay on the ﬂoor, reaching up with his arm
to the ass (for he was giving it wine to drink). “Speak, you unspeakable
one: what have you done here!

You seem transformed to me, your eyes glow, the cloak of the sublime
lies about your ugliness: What have you done?

Is what they say true after all, that you awakened him again? And why?
Were there not good grounds for killing and getting rid of him?

You yourself seem awakened to me; what have you done? Why did you
revert? Why did you convert? Speak, you unspeakable one!”

“Oh Zarathustra,” replied the ugliest human being, “you are a rogue!

Whether he still lives or lives again or is thoroughly dead — which of us
two knows that best? I ask you.

256

Fourth auol Final Part



But I know one thing — it was from you yourself that I once learned,
oh Zarathustra: whoever wants to kill most thoroughly, laughs.

‘One kills not by wrath, but by laughter' — thus you once spoke. Oh
Zarathustra, you hidden one, you annihilator without wrath, you danger—
ous saint — you are a rogue!”

2

But then it happened that Zarathustra, astounded by the sheer number
of such roguish answers, bounded back to the door of his cave and, facing
all of his guests, cried out with a strong voice:

“Oh you foolish rascals, the lot of you, you jesters! Why do you dis—
semble and disguise yourselves before me?

How the hearts of each of you squirmed with glee and malice that at
last you had become as little children again, namely pious —

— that at last you did again as children do, namely prayed, folded your
hands and said ‘dear God!'

But now leave me this nursery, my own cave, where today all manner
of childishness is at home. Cool your hot children's mischief and your
heart's noise out here!

To be sure, unless you become as little children, you shall not enter
that kingdom of heaven. (And Zarathustra gestured upward with his
hands.)

But we do want to enter the kingdom of heaven at all: we have become
men — auol so we want the kingdom ofthe earth.”

3

And once again Zarathustra began to speak. “Oh my new friends,” he
said — “you strange, you higher men, how well I like you now —

— since you've become gay again! All of you have truly blossomed; it
seems to me that ﬂowers such as you require hewfestivals,

— a small brave nonsense, some kind of divine worship and ass festival,
some kind of old gay Zarathustra fool, a sweeping wind that blows your
souls bright.

Do not forget this night and this ass festival, you higher men! This you
invented in my cave, this I take as a good omen — such things are invented
only by the convalescing!

257

Thus S polee Zara thustra



And if you celebrate it again, this ass festival, do it for your own sake,
do it also for my sake! And in remembrance of me!”

Thus spoke Zarathustra.

The S leepwalleer S orig

Meanwhile, however, one after another had stepped outdoors into the
open and into the cool, pensive night; but Zarathustra himself led the
ugliest human being by the hand, to show him his night world and the big
round moon and the silver waterfalls near his cave. There at last they all
stood together, nothing but old people, but with comforted, brave hearts
and inwardly amazed that they felt so good on earth; but the mystery of
the night came closer and closer to their hearts. And Zarathustra thought
again to himself: “Oh how well I like them now, these higher men!” —
but he did not say it aloud, for he honored their happiness and their
silence. —

But then something happened that was the most amazing thing of that
amazing long day: the ugliest human being began once more and for the
last time to gurgle and to snort, and when he had managed to put it in
words, behold, a question leaped round and ready from his mouth, a good,
deep, clear question, which moved the hearts of all who were listening to
him.

“My friends, all of you,” spoke the ugliest human being, “what do you
think? For the sake of this day — I am satisﬁed for the ﬁrst time that I have
lived my entire life.

And it's still not enough for me to attest as much as I do. It's worth it
to live on earth: one day, one festival with Zarathustra taught me to love
the earth.

‘Was that — life?' I want to say to death. ‘Well then! One More Time!'

My friends, what do you think? Do you not want to say to death, as I
do: Was that — life? For Zarathustra's sake, well then! One More Time!” —

Thus spoke the ugliest human being; but it was not long before mid—
night. And what do you think happened then? As soon as the higher
men had heard his question, all at once they became aware of their
transformation and convalescence, and of who gave it to them. Then they

258

Fourth auol Final Part



rushed toward Zarathustra, thanking, honoring, caressing him, kissing
his hands, each in his own manner; such that some laughed, some wept.
But the old soothsayer danced with joy; and even if, as some chroniclers
opine, he was full of sweet wine at the time, then he was certainly even
more full of sweet life and he had renounced all weariness. There are even
some who say that the ass also danced then; not for nothing, after all, had
the ugliest human being earlier given it wine to drink. Now this may have
happened thus or otherwise, and if in truth on that evening the ass did not
dance, then clearly even greater and rarer wonders took place there, than
the dancing of an ass would have been. In sum, as Zarathustra's saying
goes: “What does it matter!”

2

But as this went on with the ugliest human being, Zarathustra stood there
like a drunken man; his tongue slurred, his feet faltered. And who could
even guess what thoughts were speeding then through Zarathustra's soul?
Visibly, however, his spirit receded and ﬂew ahead and was in remote
distances and at the same time “upon a high ridge,” as it is written,
“between two seas,

— between the past and the future, wandering as a heavy cloud.” Gradu—
ally, however, as the higher men held him in their arms, he came to himself
a bit and used his hands to fend away the throng of the revering and the
worrying; yet he did not speak. All at once though he quickly turned his
head, because he seemed to hear something: then he put his ﬁnger to his
lips and said: “Come!”

And immediately it became still and mysterious all around; but from
the depths the sound of a bell rose slowly. Zarathustra listened for it,
as did the higher men; then he put his ﬁnger to his lips once more and
said again: “Come/ Come/ It's going on midnight!” — And his voice had
changed. But still he did not stir from his place; then it grew even more still
and mysterious, and everything listened, even the ass, and Zarathustra's
animals of honor, the eagle and the snake, and also the cave of Zarathustra
and the big cool moon and the very night. But Zarathustra put his hand
to his lips for the third time and said:

“Come/ Come/ Come/ Let us walle now! It is the hour: let us walle how into
the nightl”

259

Thus S polee Zara thustra



3

You higher men, it's going on midnight; I want to whisper something in
your ears, like that old bell whispers it into my ear —

— as secretly, as terribly, as cordially as that midnight bell, which has
experienced more than any human, says it to me:

— which long ago tallied the heartbeat beatings of your fathers — oh!
oh! how it sighs! How it laughs in dream delight, the old, the deep deep
midnight!

Still! Still! Then things are heard that by day may not be said; but now,
in the cool air, where the noise of your hearts has ﬂed —

— now it speaks, now it listens, now it creeps into nocturnal, over—awake
souls — oh! oh! how it sighs! How it laughs in dream delight!

— don't you hear, how it secretly, terribly, cordially speaks to you, the
old, the deep deep midnight?

Oh mahleiha, pray!

4

Woe to me! Where has time gone? Did I not sink into deep wells? The
world sleeps —

Alas! Alas! The dog howls, the moon shines. I would sooner die, die,
than tell you what my midnight heart is thinking right now.

Now I've died already. It's gone. Spider, why do you spin around me?
Do you want blood? Oh! Oh! The dew falls, the hour comes —

— the hour when I shiver and freeze, which asks and asks and asks:
“who has enough heart for it?

— who shall be the ruler of the earth? Who wants to say: thus you shall
ﬂow, you great and little streams!”

— the hour approaches: oh mankind, you higher men, pray! This speech
is for ﬁne ears, for your ears — what tloes deep midnight have to say?

5

It carries me away, my soul dances. Day's work! Day's work! Who shall
be ruler of the earth?

The moon is cool, the wind is silent. Alas! Alas! Have you ﬂown high
enough? You dance: but a leg is not a wing.

260

You good dancers, now all joy is gone, wine became resin, every cup
became brittle, the graves stammer.

You did not ﬂy high enough; now the graves stammer: “Redeem
the dead! Why is it night for so long? Does the moon not make us
drunk?”

You higher men, redeem the graves, awaken the corpses! Oh, why does
the worm still bore? It approaches, the hour approaches —

— the bell growls, the heart still rattles, the wood worm still bores, the
heart worm. Alas! Alas! The world is deep!

6

Sweet lyre! Sweet lyre! I love your tone, your drunken, sunken croaking
tone! — From how long ago, from how far away your tone comes to me,
from afar, from ponds of love!

You old bell, you sweet lyre! Every pain tore into your heart, father
pain, fathers' pain, forefathers' pain, your speech grew ripe —

— ripe like golden autumns and afternoons, like my hermit's heart —
now you speak: the world itself became ripe, the grape turns brown,

— now it wants to die, die of happiness. You higher men, do you not
smell it? A fragrance wells up mysteriously,

— a fragrance and aroma of eternity, a rosy blissful, brown golden wine
aroma of ancient happiness,

— of drunken, midnight, dying happiness, which sings: the world is
deep anal deeper than the grasp of day!

7

Let me be! Let me be! I am too pure for you. Do not touch me! Did my
world not just become perfect?

My skin is too pure for your hands. Let me be, you stupid, clumsy,
stiﬂing day! Is midnight not brighter?

The purest shall be rulers of the earth, the least known, strongest, the
midnight—souled, who are brighter and deeper than any day.

Oh day, you grope for me? You fumble for my happiness? I seem rich
to you, lonely, buried treasure, a chamber of gold?

Oh world, you want me? Am I worldly to you? Am I spiritual to you?
Am I godlike to you? But day and world, you are too crude —

— have smarter hands, reach for deeper happiness, for deeper unhap—
piness, reach for some kind of god — do not reach for me:

— my unhappiness, my happiness is deep, you strange day, but still I am
no god, no god's hell: deep is its pain.

8

God's pain is deeper, you strange world! Reach for god's pain, not for me!
What am I? A drunken sweet lyre —

a midnight lyre, a bell—toad that no one understands, but that must
speak, before the deaf, you higher men! For you do not understand me!

Gone! Gone! Oh youth! Oh noon! Oh afternoon! Now evening's come
and night and midnight — the dog howls, the wind:

— is the wind not a dog? It whimpers, it yelps, it howls. Alas! Oh how
midnight sighs, how it laughs, how it rattles and wheezes!

How she speaks soberly just now, this drunken poetess! Perhaps she
overdrank her drunkenness? She became over—awake? She ruminates?

— she ruminates her pain, in dream, the old deep midnight, and even
more her joy. Because joy, even if pain is deep: joy is deeper still thah
misery.

You grapevine! Why do you praise me! I cut you! I am cruel, you bleed —
what does your praise want of my drunken cruelty?

“What became perfect, everything ripe — wants to die!” so you speak.
Blessed, blessed be the Vintner's knife! But everything unripe wants to
live, alas!

Pain says: “Refrain! Away, you pain But everything that suffers wants
to live, to become ripe and joyful and longing,

— longing for what is farther, higher, brighter. “I want heirs,” thus
speaks all that suffers, “I want children, I do not want myself” —

But joy does not want heirs, not children — joy wants itself,
wants eternity, wants recurrence, wants everything eternally the
same.

Pain says: “Break, bleed, heart! Walk, legs! Wings, ﬂy! Up! Upward!
Pain!” Well then, well now, old heart! Paih says: “Refraih/ ”

You higher men, what do you think? Am I a soothsayer? A dreamer? A
drunk? A dream interpreter? A midnight bell?

A drop of dew? A haze and fragrance of eternity? Do you not hear it?
Do you not smell it? Just now my world became perfect, midnight is also
noon —

Pain is also a joy, a curse is also a blessing, night is also a sun — go away
or else you will learn: a wise man is also a fool.

Have you ever said Yes to one joy? Oh my friends, then you also said
Yes to all pain. All things are enchained, entwined, enamored —

— if you ever wanted one time two times, if you ever said “I like you,
happiness! Whoosh! Moment!” then you wanted everything back!

— Everything anew, everything eternal, everything enchained,
entwined, enamored, oh thus you loveol the world —

— you eternal ones, love it eternally and for all time; and say to pain
also: refrain, but come back! For all joy wants 7 eterhity/

All joy want the eternity of all things, wants honey, wants resin, wants
drunken midnight, wants graves, wants tomb—tears' solace, wants gilded
sunset —

— what does joy not want? It is thirstier, heartier, hungrier, more terrible,
more mysterious than all pain, it wants itself, it bites into itself, the ring's
will wrestles in it —

— it wants love, it wants hate, it is super—rich, bestows, throws away,
begs for someone to take it, thanks the taker, it would like to be
hated —

— so rich is its joy that it thirsts for pain, for hell, for hate, for disgrace,
for the cripple, for worlol — this world, oh you know it well!

You higher men, it longs for you, does joy, the unruly, blissful one — for
your pain, you failures! All eternal joy longs for failures.

For all joy wants itself, and therefore it wants all misery too! Oh happi—

Have you now learned my song? Have you guessed what it means? Well

Sing me this song yourselves now, whose name is “One More Time,”

Oh mankind, pray!

What does deep midnight have to say?
“From sleep, from sleep 7

From deepest dream I made my way: 7
The world is deep,

The Sign

But in the morning after this night Zarathustra sprang from his sleeping
place, girded his loins and came out from his cave, glowing and strong,
like a morning sun that emerges from dark mountains.



THOUGH brilliantly sunny, Saturday morning was overcoat weather again, not just
topcoat weather, as it had been all week and as everyone had hoped it would stay for the
big weekend— the weekend of the Yale game. Of the twenty-some young men who were
waiting at the station for their dates to arrive on the ten-fifty-two, no more than six or
seven were out on the cold, open platform. The rest were standing around in hatless,
smoky little groups of twos and threes and fours inside the heated waiting room, talking
in voices that, almost without exception, sounded collegiately dogmatic, as though each
young man, in his strident, conversational turn, was clearing up, once and for all, some
highly controversial issue, one that the outside, non-matriculating world had been
bungling, provocatively or not, for centuries.

    Lane Coutell, in a Burberry raincoat that apparently had a wool liner buttoned into it,
was one of the six or seven boys out on the open platform. Or, rather, he was and he
wasn't one of them. For ten minutes or more, he had deliberately been standing just out of
conversation range of the other boys, his back against the free Christian Science literature
rack, his ungloved hands in his coat pockets. He was wearing a maroon cashmere muffler
which had hiked up on his neck, giving him next to no protection against the cold.
Abruptly, and rather absently, he took his right hand out of his coat pocket and started to
adjust the muffler, but before it was adjusted, he changed his mind and used the same
hand to reach inside his coat and take out a letter from the inside pocket of his jacket. He
began to read it immediately, with his mouth not quite closed.



    The letter was written—typewritten—on pale-blue notepaper. It had a handled,
unfresh look, as if it had been taken out of its envelope and read several times before:



Tuesday I think

DEAREST LANE,

     I have no idea if you will be able to decipher this as the noise in the dorm is
absolutely incredible tonight and I can hardly hear myself think. So if I spell anything
wrong kindly have the kindness to overlook it. Incidentally I've taken your advice and
resorted to the dictionary a lot lately, so if it cramps my style your to blame. Anyway I
just got your beautiful letter and I love you to pieces, distraction, etc., and can hardly wait
for the weekend. It's too bad about not being able to get ,me in Croft House, but I don't
actually care where I stay as long as it's warm and no bugs and I see you occasionally, i.e.



every single minute. I've been going i.e. crazy lately. I absolutely adore your letter,
especially the part about Eliot. I think I'm beginning to look down on all poets except
Sappho. I've been reading her like mad, and no vulgar remarks, please. I may even do my
term thing on her if I decide to go out for honors and if I can get the moron they assigned
me as an advisor to let me. "Delicate Adonis is dying, Cytherea, what shall we do? Beat
your breasts, maidens, and rend your tunics." Isn't that marvellous? She keeps doing that,
too. Do you love me? You didn't say once in your horrible letter. I hate you when your
being hopelessly super-male and retiscent (sp.?). Not really hate you but am
constitutionally against strong, silent men. Not that you aren't strong but you know what I
mean. It's getting so noisy in here I can hardly hear myself think. Anyway I love you and
want to get this off special delivery so you can get it in plenty of time if I can find a
stamp in this madhouse. I love you I love you I love you. Do you actually know I've only
danced with you twice in eleven months? Not counting that time at the Vanguard when
you were so tight. I'll probably be hopelessly selfconscious. Incidentally I'll kill you if
there's a receiving line at this thing. Till Saturday, my flower!!

    All my love,

         FRANNY

     P.S. Daddy got his X-rays back from the hospital and we're all so relieved. Its a
growth but it isn't malignant. I spoke to Mother on the phone last night. Incidentally she
sent her regards to you, so you can relax about that Friday night. I don't even think they
heard us come in.

     P.P.S. I sound so unintelligent and dimwitted when I write to you. Why? I give you
my permission to analyze it. Let's just try to have a marvelous time this weekend. I mean
not try to analyze everything to death for once, if possible, especially me. I love you.

    FRANCES (her   mark)



     Lane was about halfway through this particular reading of the letter when he was
interrupted —intruded upon, trespassed upon—by a burly-set young man named Ray
Sorenson, who wanted to know if Lane knew what this bastard Rilke was all about. Lane
and Sorenson were both in Modern European Literature 251 (open to seniors and
graduate students only) and had been assigned the Fourth of Rilke's "Duino Elegies" for
Monday. Lane, who knew Sorenson only slightly but had a vague, categorical aversion to
his face and manner, put away his letter and said that he didn't know but that he thought
he'd understood most of it. "You're lucky," Sorenson said. "You're a fortunate man." His
voice carried with a minimum of vitality, as though he had come over to speak to Lane
out of boredom or restiveness, not for any sort of human discourse. "Christ, it's cold," he
said, and took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. Lane noticed a faded but distracting



enough lipstick streak on the lapel of Sorenson's camel's-hair coat. It looked as though it
had been there for weeks, maybe months, but he didn't know Sorenson well enough to
mention it, nor, for that matter, did he give a damn. Besides, the train was arriving. Both
boys turned a sort of half left to face the incoming engine. Almost at the same time, the
door to the waiting room banged open, and the boys who had been keeping themselves
warm began to come out to meet the train, most of them giving the impression of having
at least three lighted cigarettes in each hand.

     Lane himself lit a cigarette as the train pulled in. Then, like so many people, who,
perhaps, ought to be issued only a very probational pass to meet trains, he tried to empty
his face of all expression that might quite simply, perhaps even beautifully, reveal how he
felt about the arriving person.

    Franny was among the first of the girls to get off the train, from a car at the far,
northern end of the platform. Lane spotted her immediately, and despite whatever it was
he was trying to do with his face, his arm that shot up into the air was the whole truth.
Franny saw it, and him, and waved extravagantly back. She was wearing a sheared-
raccoon coat, and Lane, walking toward her quickly but with a slow face, reasoned to
himself, with suppressed excitement, that he was the only one on the platform who really
knew Franny's coat. He remembered that once, in a borrowed car, after kissing Franny for
a half hour or so, he had kissed her coat lapel, as though it were a perfectly desirable,
organic extension of the person herself.

    "Lane!" Franny greeted him pleasurably—and she was not one for emptying her face
of expression. She threw her arms around him and kissed him. It was a station-platform
kiss—spontaneous enough to begin with, but rather inhibited in the follow-through, and
with somewhat of a forehead-bumping aspect. "Did you get my letter?" she asked, and
added, almost in the same breath, "You look almost frozen, you poor man. Why didn't
you wait inside? Did you get my letter?"

     "Which letter?" Lane said, picking up her suitcase. It was navy blue with white
leather binding, like half a dozen other suitcases that had just been carried off the train.

    "You didn't get it? I mailed it Wednesday. Oh, God! I even took it down to the
post—"

    "Oh, that one. Yes. This all the bags you brought? What's the book?"

     Franny looked down at her left hand. She had a small pea-green clothbound book in
it. "This? Oh, just something," she said. She opened her handbag and stuffed the book
into it, and followed Lane down the long platform toward the taxi stand. She put her arm
through his, and did most of the talking, if not all of it. There was something, first, about
a dress in her bag that had to be ironed. She said she'd bought a really darling little iron
that looked like it went with a doll house, but had forgotten to bring it. She said she didn't
think she'd known more than three girls on the train—Martha Farrar, Tippie Tibbett, and
Eleanor somebody, whom she'd met years ago, in her boarding-school days, at Exeter or



someplace. Everybody else on the train, Franny said, looked very Smith, except for two
absolutely Vassar types and one absolutely Bennington or Sarah Lawrence type. The
Ben-nington-Sarah Lawrence type looked like she'd spent the whole train ride in the
John, sculpting or painting or something, or as though she had a leotard on under her
dress. Lane, walking rather too fast, said he was sorry he hadn't been able to get her into
Croft House—that was hopeless, of course—but that he'd got her into this very nice, cozy
place. Small, but clean and all that. She'd like it, he said, and Franny immediately had a
vision of a white clapboard rooming house. Three girls who didn't know each other in
one room. Whoever got there first would get the lumpy day bed to herself, and the other
two would share a double bed with an absolutely fantastic mattress. "Lovely," she said
with enthusiasm. Sometimes it was hell to conceal her impatience over the male of the
species' general ineptness, and Lane's in particular. It reminded her of a rainy night in
New York, just after theatre, when Lane, with a suspicious excess of curb-side charity,
had let that really horrible man in the dinner jacket take that taxi away from him. She
hadn't especially minded that—that is, God, it would be awful to have to be a man and
have to get taxis in the rain—but she remembered Lane's really horrible, hostile look at
her as he reported back to the curb. Now, feeling oddly guilty as she thought about that
and other things, she gave Lane's arm a special little pressure of simulated affection. The
two of them got into a cab. The navy-blue bag with the white leather binding went up
front with the driver.

    "We'll drop your bag and stuff where you're staying—just chuck them in the door—
and then we'll go get some lunch," Lane said. "I'm starved." He leaned forward and gave
an address to the driver.

     "Oh, it's lovely to see you!" Franny said as the cab moved off. "I've missed you." The
words were no sooner out than she realized that she didn't mean them at all. Again with
guilt, she took Lane's hand and tightly, warmly laced fingers with him.




ABOUT an hour later, the two were sitting at a comparatively isolated table in a
restaurant called Sickler's, downtown, a highly favored place among, chiefly, the
intellectual fringe of students at the college—the same students, more or less, who, had
they been Yale or Harvard men, might rather too casually have steered their dates away
from Mory's or Cronin's. Sickler's, it might be said, was the only restaurant in town where
the steaks weren't "that thick"— thumb and index finger held an inch apart. Sickler's was
Snails. Sickler's was where a student and his date either both ordered salad or, usually,
neither of them did, because of the garlic seasoning. Franny and Lane were both having
Martinis. When the drinks had first been served to them, ten or fifteen minutes earlier,

    Lane had sampled his, then sat back and briefly looked around the room with an
almost palpable sense of well-being at finding himself (he must have been sure no one
could dispute) in the right place with an unimpeachably right-looking girl—a girl who



was not only extraordinarily pretty but, so much the better, not too categorically
cashmere sweater and flannel skirt. Franny had seen this momentary little exposure, and
had taken it in for what it was, neither more nor less. But by some old, standing
arrangement with her psyche, she elected to feel guilty for having seen it, caught it, and
sentenced herself to listen to Lane's ensuing conversation with a special semblance of
absorption.

     Lane was speaking now as someone does who has been monopolizing conversation
for a good quarter of an hour or so and who believes he has just hit a stride where his
voice can do absolutely no wrong. "I mean, to put it crudely," he was saying, "the thing
you could say he lacks is testicularity. Know what I mean?" He was slouched rhetorically
forward, toward Franny, his receptive audience, a supporting forearm on either side of his
Martini.

    "Lacks what?" Franny said. She had had to clear her throat before speaking, it had
been so long since she had said anything at all.

    Lane hesitated. "Masculinity," he said.

    "I heard you the first time."

    "Anyway, that was the motif of the thing, so to speak—what I was trying to bring out
in a fairly subtle way," Lane said, very closely following the trend of his own
conversation. "I mean, God. 1 honestly thought it was going to go over like a goddam
lead balloon, and when I got it back with this goddam 'A' on it in letters about six feet
high, I swear I nearly keeled over."

    Franny again cleared her throat. Apparently her self-imposed sentence of
unadulterated good-listenership had been fully served. "Why?" she asked.

    Lane looked faintly interrupted. "Why what?"

    "Why'd you think it was going to go over like a lead balloon?"

    "I just told you. I just got through saying. This guy Brughman is a big Flaubert man.
Or at least I thought he was."

     "Oh," Franny said. She smiled. She sipped her Martini. "This is marvellous," she
said, looking at the glass. "I'm so glad it's not about twenty to one. I hate it when they're
absolutely all gin."

    Lane nodded. "Anyway, I think I've got the goddam paper in my room. If we get a
chance over the weekend, I'll read it to you."

    "Marvellous. I'd love to hear it."


  Lane nodded again. "I mean I didn't say anything too goddam world-shaking or
anything like that." He shifted his position in the chair. "But—I don't know—I think the
emphasis I put on why he was so neurotically attracted to the mot juste wasn't too bad. I
mean in the light of what we know today. Not just psychoanalysis and all that crap, but
certainly to a certain extent. You know what I mean. I'm no Freudian man or anything
like that, but certain things you can't just pass over as capital-F Freudian and let them go
at that. I mean to a certain extent I think I was perfectly justified to point out that none of
the really good boys—Tolstoy, Dostoevski, Shakespeare, for Chrissake—were such
goddam word-squeezers. They just wrote. Know what I mean?" Lane looked at Franny
somewhat expectantly. She seemed to him to have been listening with extra-special
intentness.

    "You going to eat your olive, or what?"

    Lane gave his Martini glass a brief glance, then looked back at Franny. "No," he said
coldly. "You want it?"

    "If you don't," Franny said. She knew from Lane's expression that she had asked the
wrong question. What was worse, she suddenly didn't want the olive at all and wondered
why she had even asked for it. There was nothing to do, though, when Lane extended his
Martini glass to her but to accept the olive and consume it with apparent relish. She then
took a cigarette from Lane's pack on the table, and he lit it for her and one for himself.

     After the interruption of the olive, a short silence came over the table. When Lane
broke it, it was because he was not one to keep a punch line to himself for any length of
time. "This guy Brughman thinks I ought to publish the goddam paper somewhere," he
said abruptly. "I don't know, though." Then, as though he had suddenly become
exhausted — or, rather, depleted by the demands made on him by a world greedy for the
fruit of his intellect—he began to massage the side of his face with the flat of his hand,
removing, with unconscious crassness, a bit of sleep from one eye. "I mean critical essays
on Flaubert and those boys are a goddam dime a dozen." He reflected, looking a trifle
morose. "As a matter of fact, I don't think there've been any really incisive jobs done on
him in the last—"

    "You're talking like a section man. But exactly."

    "I beg your pardon?" Lane said with measured quietness.

    "You're talking exactly like a section man. I'm sorry, but you are. You really are."

    "I am? How does a section man talk, may I ask?"

     Franny saw that he was irritated, and to what extent, but, for the moment, with equal
parts of self-disapproval and malice, she felt like speaking her mind. "Well, I don't know
what they are around here, but where I come from, a section man's a person that takes
over a class when the professor isn't there or is busy having a nervous breakdown or is at



the dentist or something. He's usually a graduate student or something. Anyway, if it's a
course in Russian Literature, say, he comes in, in his little button-down-collar shirt and
striped tie, and starts knocking Tur-genev for about a half hour. Then, when he's finished,
when he's completely ruined Turgenev for you, he starts talking about Stendhal or
somebody he wrote his thesis for his M.A. on. Where I go, the English Department has
about ten little section men running around ruining things for people, and they're all so
brilliant they can hardly open their mouths—pardon the contradiction. I mean if you get
into an argument with them, all they do is get this terribly benign expression on their—"

    "You've got a goddam bug today—you know that? What the hell's the matter with
you anyway?"

     Franny quickly tipped her cigarette ash, then brought the ashtray an inch closer to her
side of the table. "I'm sorry. I'm awful," she said. "I've just felt so destructive all week. It's
awful, I'm horrible."

    "Your letter didn't sound so goddam destructive."

     Franny nodded solemnly. She was looking at a little warm blotch of sunshine, about
the size of a poker chip, on the tablecloth. "I had to strain to write it," she said.

     Lane started to say something to that, but the waiter was suddenly there to take away
the empty Martini glasses. "You want another one?" Lane asked Franny.

    He didn't get an answer. Franny was staring at the little blotch of sunshine with a
special intensity, as if she were considering lying down in it.

   "Franny," Lane said patiently, for the waiter's benefit. "Would you like another
Martini, or what?"

    She looked up. "I'm sorry." She looked at the removed, empty glasses in the waiter's
hand. "No. Yes. I don't know."

    Lane gave a laugh, looking at the waiter. "Which is it?" he said.

    "Yes, please." She looked more alert.

     The waiter left. Lane watched him leave the room, then looked back at Franny. She
was shaping her cigarette ash on the side of the fresh ashtray the waiter had brought, her
mouth not quite closed. Lane watched her for a moment with mounting irritation. Quite
probably, he resented and feared any signs of detachment in a girl he was seriously
dating. In any case, he surely was concerned over the possibility that this bug Franny had
might bitch up the whole weekend. He suddenly leaned forward, putting his arms on the
table, as though to get this thing ironed out, by God, but Franny spoke up before he did.
"I'm lousy today," she said. "I'm just way off today." She found herself looking at Lane as
if he were a stranger, or a poster advertising a brand of linoleum, across the aisle of a



subway car. Again she felt the trickle of disloyalty and guilt, which seemed to be the
order of the day, and reacted to it by reaching over to cover Lane's hand with her own.
She withdrew her hand almost immediately and used it to pick her cigarette out of the
ashtray. "I'll snap out of this in a minute," she said. "I absolutely promise." She smiled at
Lane—in a sense, genuinely —and at that moment a smile in return might at least have
mitigated to some small extent certain events that were to follow, but Lane was busy
affecting a brand of detachment of his own, and chose not to smile back. Franny dragged
on her cigarette. "If it weren't so late and everything," she said, "and if I hadn't decided
like a fool to go out for honors, I think I'd drop English. I don't know." She tipped her
ashes. "I'm just so sick of pedants and conceited little tearer-downers I could scream."
She looked at Lane. "I'm sorry. I'll stop. I give you my word. . . . It's just that if I'd had
any guts at all, I wouldn't have gone back to college at all this year. I don't know. I mean
it's all the most incredible farce."

    "Brilliant. That's really brilliant."

    Franny took the sarcasm as her due. "I'm sorry," she said.

    "Stop saying you're sorry—do you mind? I don't suppose it's occurred to you that
you're making one helluva sweeping generalization. If all English Department people
were such great little tearer-downers, it would be an altogether different—"

    Franny interrupted him, but almost inau-dibly. She was looking over his charcoal
flannel shoulder at some abstraction across the dining room.

    "What?" Lane asked.

    "I said I know. You're right. I'm just off, that's all. Don't pay any attention to me."

     But Lane couldn't let a controversy drop until it had been resolved in his favor. "I
mean, hell," he said. "There are incompetent people in all walks of life. I mean that's
basic. Let's drop the goddam section men for a minute." He looked at Franny. "You
listening to me, or what?"

    "Yes."

   "You've got two of the best men in the country in your goddam English Department.
Man-lius. Esposito. God, I wish we had them here. At least, they're poets, for Chrissake."

     "They're not," Franny said. "That's partly what's so awful. I mean they're not real
poets. They're just people that write poems that get published and anthologized all over
the place, but they're not poets." She stopped, self-consciously, and put out her cigarette.
For several minutes now, she had seemed to be losing color in her face. Suddenly, even
her lipstick seemed a shade or two lighter, as though she had just blotted it with a leaf of
Kleenex. "Let's not talk about it," she said, almost listlessly, squashing her cigarette stub
in the ashtray. "I'm way off. I'll just ruin the whole weekend. Maybe there's a trapdoor



under my chair, and I'll just disappear."

    The waiter came forward very briefly, and left a second Martini in front of each of
them.

     Lane put his fingers—which were slender and long, and usually not far out of
sight—around the stem of his glass. "You're not ruining anything," he said quietly. "I'm
just interested in finding out what the hell goes. I mean do you have to be a goddam
bohemian type, or dead, for Chrissake, to be a real poet? What do you want—some
bastard with wavy hair?"

     "No. Can't we let it go? Please. I'm feeling absolutely lousy, and I'm getting a
terrible—"

   "I'd be very happy to drop the whole subject —I'd be delighted. Just tell me first
what a real poet is, if you don't mind. I'd appreciate it. I really would."

    There was a faint glisten of perspiration high on Franny's forehead. It might only
have meant that the room was too warm, or that her stomach was upset, or that the
Martinis were too potent; in any case, Lane didn't seem to notice it.

    "I don't know what a real poet is. I wish you'd stop it, Lane. I'm serious. I'm feeling
very peculiar and funny, and I can't—"

    "All right, all right—O.K. Relax," Lane said. "I was only trying—"

     "I know this much, is all," Franny said. "If you're a poet, you do something beautiful.
I mean you're supposed to leave something beautiful after you get off the page and
everything. The ones you're talking about don't leave a single, solitary thing beautiful. All
that maybe the slightly better ones do is sort of get inside your head and leave something
there, but just because they do, just because they know how to leave something, it doesn't
have to be a poem, for heaven's sake. It may just be some kind of terribly fascinating,
syntaxy droppings—excuse the expression. Like Manlius and Esposito and all those poor
men."

    Lane took time to light a cigarette for himself before he said anything. Then: "I
thought you liked Manlius. As a matter of fact, about a month ago, if I remember
correctly, you said he was darling, and that you—"

     "I do like him. I'm sick of just liking people. I wish to God I could meet somebody I
could respect. . . . Would you excuse me for just a minute?" Franny was suddenly on her
feet, with her handbag in her hand. She was very pale.

    Lane got up, pushing back his chair, his mouth somewhat open. "What's the matter?"
he asked. "You feel all right? Anything wrong, or what?"


   "I'll be back in just a second."

     She left the room without asking directions, as though she knew from former lunches
at Sick-ler's just where to go.

      Lane, alone at the table, sat smoking and taking conservative drinks from his Martini
to make it last till Franny got back. It was very clear that the sense of well-being he had
felt, a half hour earlier, at being in the right place with the right, or right-looking, girl was
now totally gone. He looked over at the sheared-rac-coon coat, which lay somewhat
askew over the back of Franny's vacant chair—the same coat that had excited him at the
station, by virtue of his singular familiarity with it—and he examined it now with all but
unqualified disaffection. The wrinkles in the silk lining seemed, for some reason, to
annoy him. He stopped looking at it and began to stare at the stem of his Martini glass,
looking worried and vaguely, unfairly conspired against. One thing was sure. The
weekend was certainly getting off to a goddam peculiar start. At that moment, though, he
chanced to look up from the table and see someone he knew across the room—a
classmate, with a date. Lane sat up a bit in his chair and adjusted his expression from that
of all-round apprehension and discontent to that of a man whose date has merely gone to
the John, leaving him, as dates do, with nothing to do in the meantime but smoke and
look bored, preferably attractively bored.




THE ladies' room at Sickler's was almost as large as the dining room proper, and, in a
special sense, appeared to be hardly less commodious. It was unattended and apparently
unoccupied when Franny came in. She stood for a moment —rather as though it were a
rendezvous point of some kind—in the middle of the tiled floor. Her brow was beaded
with perspiration now, her mouth was slackly open, and she was still paler than she had
been in the dining room. Abruptly, then, and very quickly, she went into the farthest and
most anonymous-looking of the seven or eight enclosures—which, by luck, didn't require
a coin for entrance—closed the door behind her, and, with some little difficulty,
manipulated the bolt to a locked position. Without any apparent regard to the suchness of
her environment, she sat down. She brought her knees together very firmly, as if to make
herself a smaller, more compact unit. Then she placed her hands, vertically, over her eyes
and pressed the heels hard, as though to paralyze the optic nerve and drown all images
into a voidlike black. Her extended fingers, though trembling, or because they were
trembling, looked oddly graceful and pretty. She held that tense, almost fetal position for
a suspensory moment—then broke down. She cried for fully five minutes. She cried
without trying to suppress any of the noisier manifestations of grief and confusion, with
all the convulsive throat sounds that a hysterical child makes when the breath is trying to
get up through a partly closed epiglottis. And yet, when finally she stopped, she merely
stopped, without the painful, knifelike intakes of breath that usually follow a violent
outburst-inburst. When she stopped, it was as though some momentous change of polarity
had taken place inside her mind, one that had an immediate, pacifying effect on her body.


Her face tear-streaked but quite expressionless, almost vacuous, she picked up her
handbag from the floor, opened it, and took out the small pea-green clothbound book.
She put it on her lap—on her knees, rather—and looked down at it, gazed down at it, as if
that were the best of all places for a small pea-green clothbound book to be. After a
moment, she picked up the book, raised it chest-high, and pressed it to her—firmly, and
quite briefly. Then she put it back into the handbag, stood up, and came out of the
enclosure. She washed her face with cold water, dried it with a towel from an overhead
rack, applied fresh lipstick, combed her hair, and left the room.

     She looked quite stunning as she walked across the dining room to the table, not at
all unlike a girl on the qui vive appropriate to a big college weekend. As she came
briskly, smiling, to her chair, Lane slowly got up, a napkin in his left hand.

    "God. I'm sorry," Franny said. "Did you think I'd died?"

    "I didn't think you'd died," Lane said. He drew her chair for her. "I didn't know what
the hell happened." He went around to his own chair. "We don't have any too goddam
much time, you know." He sat down. "You all right? Your eyes are a little bloodshot." He
looked at her more closely. "You O.K., or what?"

    Franny lit a cigarette. "I'm marvellous now. I just never felt so fantastically rocky in
my entire life. Did you order?"

    "I waited for you," Lane said, still looking at her closely. "What was the matter
anyway? Your stomach?"

     "No. Yes and no. I don't know," Franny said. She looked down at the menu on her
plate, and consulted it without picking it up. "All I want's a chicken sandwich. And
maybe a glass of milk. ... You order what you want and all, though. I mean, take snails
and octopuses and things. Octopi. I'm really not at all hungry."

    Lane looked at her, then exhaled a thin, overly expressive stream of smoke down at
his plate. "This is going to be a real little doll of a weekend," he said. "A chicken
sandwich, for God's sake."

    Franny was annoyed. "I'm not hungry, Lane —I'm sorry. My gosh. Now, please. You
order what you want, why don't you, and I'll eat while you're eating. But I can't just work
up an appetite because you want me to."

     "All right, all right." Lane craned his neck and caught the waiter's attention. A
moment later, he ordered the chicken sandwich and the glass of milk for Franny, and
snails, frogs' legs, and a salad for himself. He looked at his wrist-watch when the waiter
had gone, and said, "We're supposed to be up at Tenbridge at one-fifteen, one-thirty,
incidentally. No later. I told Wally we'd probably stop off for a drink and then maybe
we'd all go out to the stadium together in his car. You mind? You like Wally."

   "I don't even know who he is."

    "You've met him about twenty times, for God's sake. Wally Campbell. Jesus. If
you've met him once, you've met him—"

     "Oh. I remember. . . . Listen, don't hate me because I can't remember some person
immediately. Especially when they look like everybody else, and talk and dress and act
like everybody else." Franny made her voice stop. It sounded to her cavilling and bitchy,
and she felt a wave of self-hatred that, quite literally, made her forehead begin to perspire
again. But her voice picked up again, in spite of herself. "I don't mean there's anything
horrible about him or anything like that. It's just that for four solid years I've kept seeing
Wally Campbells wherever I go. I know when they're going to be charming, I know when
they're going to start telling you some really nasty gossip about some girl that lives in
your dorm, I know when they're going to ask me what I did over the summer, I know
when they're going to pull up a chair and straddle it backward and start bragging in a
terribly, terribly quiet voice—or name-dropping in a terribly quiet, casual voice. There's
an unwritten law that people in a certain social or financial bracket can name-drop as
much as they like just as long as they say something terribly disparaging about the person
as soon as they've dropped his name—that he's a bastard or a nymphomaniac or takes
dope all the time, or something horrible." She broke off again. She was quiet for a
moment, turning the ashtray in her fingers and being careful not to look up and see Lane's
expression. "I'm sorry," she said. "It isn't just Wally Campbell. I'm just picking on him
because you mentioned him. And because he just looks like somebody that spent the
summer in Italy or someplace."

    "He was in France last summer, for your information," Lane stated. "I know what
you mean," he added quickly, "but you're being goddam un—"

     "All right," Franny said wearily. "France." She took a cigarette out of the pack on the
table. "It isn't just Wally. It could be a girl, for goodness' sake. I mean if he were a girl—
somebody in my dorm, for example—he'd have been painting scenery in some stock
company all summer. Or bicycled through Wales. Or taken an apartment in New York
and worked for a magazine or an advertising company. It's everybody, I mean. Everything
everybody does is so—I don't know—not wrong, or even mean, or even stupid
necessarily. But just so tiny and meaningless and—sad-making. And the worst part is, if
you go bohemian or something crazy like that, you're conforming just as much as
everybody else, only in a different way." She stopped. She shook her head briefly, her
face quite white, and for just a fractional moment she felt her forehead with her hand—
less, it seemed, to find out whether she was perspiring than to check to see, as if she were
her own parent, whether she had a fever. "I feel so funny," she said. "I think I'm going
crary. Maybe I'm already crazy."

   Lane was looking at her with genuine concern—more concern than curiosity.
"You're pale as hell. You're really pale—you know that?" he asked.

    Franny shook her head. "I'm fine. I'll be fine in a minute." She looked up as the



waiter came forward with their orders. "Oh, your snails look beautiful." She had just
brought her cigarette to her lips, but it had gone out. "What'd you do with the matches?"
she asked.

    Lane gave her a light when the waiter had gone. "You smoke too much," he said. He
picked up the small fork beside his plate of snails, but looked at Franny again before he
used it. "I'm worried about you. I'm serious. What the hell's happened to you in the last
couple of weeks?"

   Franny looked at him, then simultaneously shrugged and shook her head. "Nothing.
Absolutely nothing," she said. "Eat. Eat them snails. They're terrible if they're cold."

    "You eat."

    Franny nodded and looked down at her chicken sandwich. She felt a faint wave of
nausea, and looked up immediately and dragged on her cigarette.

    "How's the play?" Lane asked, attending to his snails.

    "I don't know. I'm not in it. I quit."

    "You quit?" Lane looked up. "I thought you were so mad about the part. What
happened? They give it to somebody else?"

    "No, they did not. It was all mine. That's nasty. Oh, that's nasty."

    "Well, what happened? You didn't quit the whole department, did you?"

    Franny nodded, and took a sip of her milk. Lane waited till he had chewed and
swallowed, then said, "Why, for God's sake? I thought the goddam theatre was your
passion. It's about the only thing I've ever heard you—"

     "I just quit, that's all," Franny said. "It started embarrassing me. I began to feel like
such a nasty little egomaniac." She reflected. "I don't know. It seemed like such poor
taste, sort of, to want to act in the first place. I mean all the ego. And I used to hate
myself so, when I was in a play, to be backstage after the play was over. All those egos
running around feeling terribly charitable and warm. Kissing everybody and wearing
their makeup all over the place, and then trying to be horribly natural and friendly when
your friends came backstage to see you. I just hated myself. . . . And the worst part was I
was usually sort of ashamed to be in the plays I was in. Especially in summer stock." She
looked at Lane. "And I had good parts, so don't look at me that way. It wasn't that. It was
just that I would've been ashamed if, say, anybody I respected—my brothers, for
example—came and heard me deliver some of the lines I had to say. I used to write
certain people and tell them not to come." She reflected again. "Except Pegeen in
'Playboy,' last summer. I mean that could have been really nice, only the goon that played
the Playboy spoiled any fun it might have been. He was so lyrical—God, was he lyrical!"

    Lane had finished his snails. He sat looking deliberately expressionless. "He got
terrific reviews," he said. "You sent me the reviews, if you recall."

    Franny sighed. "All right. O.K., Lane."

     "No, I mean you've been talking for a half hour as though you're the only person in
the world that's got any goddam sense, any critical ability. I mean if some of the best
critics thought this man was terrific in the play, maybe he was, maybe you're wrong. That
ever occur to you? You know, you haven't exactly reached the ripe, old—"

     "He was terrific for somebody that just has talent. If you're going to play the Playboy
right, you have to be a genius. You do, that's all—I can't help it," Franny said. She arched
her back a trifle, and, with her mouth a trifle open, she put her hand on top of her head. "I
feel so woozy and funny. I don't know what's the matter with me."

    "You think you're a genius?"

    Franny took her hand down from her head. "Aw, Lane. Please. Don't do that to me."

    "I'm not doing any—"

    "All I know is I'm losing my mind," Franny said. "I'm just sick of ego, ego, ego. My
own and everybody else's. I'm sick of everybody that wants to get somewhere, do
something distinguished and all, be somebody interesting. It's disgusting —it is, it is. I
don't care what anybody says."

    Lane raised his eyebrows at that, and sat back, the better to make his point. "You
sure you're just not afraid of competing?" he asked with studied quietness. "I don't know
too much about it, but I'd lay odds a good psychoanalyst—I mean a really competent
one—would probably take that statement—"

      "I'm not afraid to compete. It's just the opposite. Don't you see that? I'm afraid I will
compete—that's what scares me. That's why I quit the Theatre Department. Just because
I'm so horribly conditioned to accept everybody else's values, and just because I like
applause and people to rave about me, doesn't make it right. I'm ashamed of it. I'm sick of
it. I'm sick of not having the courage to be an absolute nobody. I'm sick of myself and
everybody else that wants to make some kind of a splash." She paused, and suddenly
picked up her glass of milk and brought it to her lips. "I knew it," she said, setting it
down. "That's something new. My teeth go funny on me. They're chattering. I nearly bit
through a glass the day before yesterday. Maybe I'm stark, staring mad and don't know
it." The waiter had come forward to serve Lane's frogs' legs and salad, and Franny looked
up at him. He, in turn, looked down at her untouched chicken sandwich. He asked if the
young lady would perhaps like to change her order. Franny thanked him, and said no.
"I'm just very slow," she said. The waiter, who was not a young man, seemed to look for
an instant at her pallor and damp brow, then bowed and left.


  "You want to use this a second?" Lane said abruptly. He was holding out a folded,
white handkerchief. His voice sounded sympathetic, kind, in spite of some perverse
attempt to make it sound matter-of-fact.

    "Why? Do I need it?"

    "You're sweating. Not sweating, but I mean your forehead's perspiring quite a bit."

    "It is? How horrible! I'm sorry. . . ." Franny brought her handbag up to table level,
opened it, and began to rummage through it. "I have some Kleenex somewhere."

    "Use my handkerchief, for God's sake. What the hell's the difference?"

     'Wo—I love that handkerchief and I'm not going to get it all perspiry," Franny said.
Her handbag was a crowded one. To see better, she began to unload a few things and
place them on the tablecloth, just to the left of her untasted sandwich. "Here it is," she
said. She used a compact mirror and quickly, lightly blotted her brow with a leaf of
Kleenex. "God. I look like a ghost. How can you stand me?"

    "What's the book?" Lane asked.




FRANNY literally jumped. She looked down at the disorderly little pile of handbag
freight on the tablecloth. "What book?" she said. "This, you mean?" She picked up the
little clothbound book and put it back into her handbag. "Just something I brought to look
at on the train."

    "Let's have a look. What is it?"

     Franny didn't seem to hear him. She opened her compact again and took another
quick glance into the mirror. "God," she said. Then she cleared everything—compact,
billfold, laundry bill, toothbrush, a tin of aspirins, and a gold-plated swizzle stick—back
into her handbag. "I don't know why I carry that crazy gold swizzle stick around," she
said. "A very corny boy gave it to me when I was a sophomore, for my birthday. He
thought it was such a beautiful and inspired gift, and he kept watching my face while I
opened the package. I keep trying to throw it away, but I simply can't do it. I'll go to my
grave with it." She reflected. "He kept grinning at me and telling me I'd always have good
luck if I kept it with me at all times."

    Lane had started in on his frogs' legs. "What was the book, anyway? Or is it a
goddam secret or something?" he asked.

    "The little book in my bag?" Franny said. She watched him disjoint a pair of frogs'



legs. Then she took a cigarette from the pack on the table and lit it herself. "Oh, I don't
know," she said. "It's something called 'The Way of a Pilgrim.' " She watched Lane eat
for a moment. "I got it out of the library. This man that teaches this Religion Survey thing
I'm taking this term mentioned it." She dragged on her cigarette.

    "I've had it out for weeks. I keep forgetting to return it."

    "Who wrote it?"

     "I don't know," Franny said casually. "Some Russian peasant, apparently." She went
on watching Lane eat his frogs' legs. "He never gives his name. You never know his
name the whole time he's telling the story. He just tells you he's a peasant and that he's
thirty-three years old and that he's got a withered arm. And that his wife is dead. It's all in
the eighteen-hundreds."

     Lane had just shifted his attention from the frogs' legs to the salad. "Any good?" he
said. "What's it about?"

     "I don't know. It's peculiar. I mean it's primarily a religious book. In a way, I suppose
you could say it's terribly fanatical, but in a way it isn't. I mean it starts out with this
peasant—the pilgrim—wanting to find out what it means in the Bible when it says you
should pray incessantly. You know. Without stopping. In Thessa-lonians or someplace.
So he starts out walking all over Russia, looking for somebody who can tell him how to
pray incessantly. And what you should say if you do." Franny seemed intensely interested
in the way Lane was dismembering his frogs' legs. Her eyes remained fixed on his plate
as she spoke. "All he carries with him is this knapsack filled with bread and salt. Then he
meets this person called a starets—some sort of terribly advanced religious person—and
the starets tells him about a book called the Thilokalia.' "Which apparently was written by
a group of terribly advanced monks who sort of advocated this really incredible method
of praying."

    "Hold still," Lane said to a pair of frogs' legs.

    "Anyway, so the pilgrim learns how to pray the way these very mystical persons say
you should—I mean he keeps at it till he's perfected it and everything. Then he goes on
walking all over Russia, meeting all kinds of absolutely marvellous people and telling
them how to pray by this incredible method. I mean that's really the whole book."

    "I hate to mention it, but I'm going to reek of garlic," Lane said.

     "He meets this one married couple, on one of his journeys, that I love more than
anybody I ever read about in my entire life," Franny said. "He's walking down a road
somewhere in the country, with his knapsack on his back, when these two tiny little
children run after him, shouting, 'Dear little beggar! Dear little beggar! You must come
home to Mummy. She likes beggars.' So he goes home with the children, and this really
lovely person, the children's mother, comes out of the house all in a bustle and insists on


helping him take off his dirty old boots and giving him a cup of tea. Then the father
comes home, and apparently he loves beggars and pilgrims, too, and they all sit down to
dinner. And while they're at dinner, the pilgrim wants to know who all the ladies are that
are sitting around the table, and the husband tells him that they're all servants but that
they always sit down to eat with him and his wife because they're sisters in Christ."
Franny suddenly sat up a trifle straighter in her seat, self-consciously. "I mean I loved the
pilgrim wanting to know who all the ladies were." She watched Lane butter a piece of
bread. "Anyway, after that, the pilgrim stays overnight, and he and the husband sit up till
late talking about this method of praying without ceasing. The pilgrim tells him how to
do it. Then he leaves in the morning and starts out on some more adventures. He meets
all kinds of people—I mean that's the whole book, really—and he tells all of them how to
pray by this special way."

     Lane nodded. He cut into his salad with his fork. "I hope to God we get time over the
weekend so that you can take a quick look at this goddam paper I told you about," he
said. "I don't know. I may not do a damn thing with it —I mean try to publish it or what
have you— but I'd like you to sort of glance through it while you're here."

   "I'd love to," Franny said. She watched him butter another piece of bread. "You
might like this book," she said suddenly. "It's so simple, I mean."

    "Sounds interesting. You don't want your butter, do you?"

    "No, take it. I can't lend it to you, because it's way overdue already, but you could
probably get it at the library here. I'm positive you could."

     "You haven't touched your goddam sandwich," Lane said suddenly. "You know
that?"

     Franny looked down at her plate as if it had just been placed before her. "I will in a
minute," she said. She sat still for a moment, holding her cigarette, but without dragging
on it, in her left hand, and with her right hand fixed tensely around the base of the glass
of milk. "Do you want to hear what the special method of praying was that the starets told
him about?" she asked. "It's really sort of interesting, in a way."

    Lane cut into his last pair of frogs' legs. He nodded. "Sure," he said. "Sure."

      "Well, as I said, the pilgrim—this simple peasant—started the whole pilgrimage to
find out what it means in the Bible when it says you're supposed to pray without ceasing.
And then he meets this starets—this very advanced religious person I mentioned, the one
who'd been studying the Thilokalia' for years and years and years." Franny stopped
suddenly to reflect, to organize. "Well, the starets tells him about the Jesus Prayer first of
all. 'Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.' I mean that's what it is. And he explains to
him that those are the best words to use when you pray. Especially the word 'mercy,'
because it's such a really enormous word and can mean so many things. I mean it doesn't
just have to mean mercy." Franny paused to reflect again. She was no longer looking at

Lane's plate but over his shoulder. "Anyway," she went on, "the starets tells the pilgrim
that if you keep saying that prayer over and over again—you only have to just do it with
your lips at first—then eventually what happens, the prayer becomes self-active.
Something happens after a while. I don't know what, but something happens, and the
words get synchronized with the person's heartbeats, and then you're actually praying
without ceasing. Which has a really tremendous, mystical effect on your whole outlook. I
mean that's the whole point of it, more or less. I mean you do it to purify your whole
outlook and get an absolutely new conception of what everything's about."

    Lane had finished eating. Now, as Franny paused again, he sat back and lit a
cigarette and watched her face. She was still looking abstractedly ahead of her, past his
shoulder, and seemed scarcely aware of his presence.

     "But the thing is, the marvellous thing is, when you first start doing it, you don't even
have to have faith in what you're doing. I mean even if you're terribly embarrassed about
the whole thing, it's perfectly all right. I mean you're not insulting anybody or anything.
In other words, nobody asks you to believe a single thing when you first start out. You
don't even have to think about what you're saying, the starets said. All you have to have
in the beginning is quantity. Then, later on, it becomes quality by itself. On its own power
or something. He says that any name of God—any name at all—has this peculiar, self-
active power of its own, and it starts working after you've sort of started it up."

    Lane sat rather slouched in his chair, smoking, his eyes narrowed attentively at
Franny's face. Her face was still pale, but it had been paler at other moments since the
two had been in Sickler's.

    "As a matter of fact, that makes absolute sense," Franny said, "because in the
Nembutsu sects of Buddhism, people keep saying 'Namu Amida Butsu' over and over
again—which means 'Praises to the Buddha' or something like that— and the same thing
happens. The exact same—"

    "Easy. Take it easy," Lane interrupted. "In the first place, you're going to burn your
fingers any second."

      Franny gave a minimal glance down at her left hand, and dropped the stub of her
still-burning cigarette into the ashtray. "The same thing happens in 'The Cloud of
Unknowing,' too. Just with the word 'God.' I mean you just keep saying the word 'God.' "
She looked at Lane more directly than she had in several minutes. "I mean the point is did
you ever hear anything so fascinating in your life, in a way? I mean it's so hard to just say
it's absolute coincidence and then just let it go at that—that's what's so fascinating to me.
At least, that's what's so terribly—" She broke off. Lane was shifting restively in his
chair, and there was an expression on his face—a matter of raised eyebrows, chiefly—
that she knew very well. "What's the matter?" she asked.

    "You actually believe that stuff, or what?"

   Franny reached for the pack of cigarettes and took one out. "I didn't say I believed it
or I didn't believe it," she said, and scanned the table for the folder of matches. "I said it
was fascinating." She accepted a light from Lane. "I just think it's a terribly peculiar
coincidence," she said, exhaling smoke, "that you keep running into that kind of advice—
I mean all these really advanced and absolutely unbogus religious persons that keep
telling you if you repeat the name of God incessantly, something happens, Even in India.
In India, they tell you to meditate on the 'Om,' which means the same thing, really, and
the exact same result is supposed to happen. So I mean you can't just rationalize it away
without even—"

    "What is the result?" Lane said shortly.

    "What?"

    "I mean what is the result that's supposed to follow? All this synchronization
business and mumbo-jumbo. You get heart trouble? I don't know if you know it, but you
could do yourself, somebody could do himself a great deal of real—"

     "You get to see God. Something happens in some absolutely nonphysical part of the
heart— where the Hindus say that Atman resides, if you ever took any Religion—and
you see God, that's all." She flicked her cigarette ash self-consciously, just missing the
ashtray. She picked up the ash with her fingers and put it in. "And don't ask me who or
what God is. I mean I don't even know if He exists. When I was little, I used to think—"
She stopped. The waiter had come to take away the dishes and redistribute menus.

    "You want some dessert, or coffee?" Lane asked.

    "I think I'll just finish my milk. But you have some," Franny said. The waiter had just
taken away her plate with the untouched chicken sandwich. She didn't dare to look up at
him.

      Lane looked at his wristwatch. "God. We don't have time. We're lucky if we get to
the game on time." He looked up at the waiter. "Just coffee for me, please." He watched
the waiter leave, then leaned forward, arms on the table, thoroughly relaxed, stomach full,
coffee due to arrive momentarily, and said, "Well, it's interesting, anyway. All that stuff
... I don't think you leave any margin for the most elementary psychology. I mean I think
all those religious experiences have a very obvious psychological background—you
know what I mean. . . . It's interesting, though. I mean you can't deny that." He looked
over at Franny and smiled at her. "Anyway. Just in case I forgot to mention it. I love you.
Did I get around to mentioning that?"

    "Lane, would you excuse me again for just a second?" Franny said. She had got up
before the question was completely out.

    Lane got up, too, slowly, looking at her. "You all right?" he asked. "You feel sick
again, or what?"


  "Just funny. I'll be right back."

     She walked briskly through the dining room, taking the same route she had taken
earlier. But she stopped quite short at the small cocktail bar at the far end of the room.
The bartender, who was wiping a sherry glass dry, looked at her. She put her right hand
on the bar, then lowered her head—bowed it—and put her left hand to her forehead, just
touching it with the fingertips. She weaved a trifle, then fainted, collapsing to the floor.




IT was nearly five minutes before Franny came thoroughly to. She was on a couch in the
manager's office, and Lane was sitting beside her. His face, suspended anxiously over
hers, had a remarkable pallor of its own now.

    "How are ya?" he said, in a rather hospital-room voice. "You feel any better?"

    Franny nodded. She closed her eyes for a second against the overhead light, then
reopened them. "Am I supposed to say 'Where am I?'" she said. "Where am I?"

     Lane laughed. "You're in the manager's office. They're all running around looking
for spirits of ammonia and doctors and things to bring you to. They'd just run out of
ammonia, apparently. How do you feel? No kidding."

    "Fine. Stupid, but fine. Did I honestly faint?"

    "And how. You really conked out," Lane said. He took her hand in his. "What do
you think's the matter with you anyway? I mean you sounded so—you know—so perfect
when I talked to you on the phone last week. Didn't you eat any breakfast, or what?"

    Franny shrugged. Her eyes looked around the room. "It's so embarrassing," she said.
"Did somebody have to carry me in here?"

     "The bartender and I. We sort of hoisted you in. You scared the hell out of me, I'm
not kidding."

    Franny looked thoughtfully, without blinking, at the ceiling while her hand was held.
Then she turned and, with her free hand, made a gesture as though to push back the cuff
of Lane's sleeve. "What time is it?" she asked.

    "Never mind that," Lane said. "We're in no hurry."

    "You wanted to go to that cocktail party."

    "The hell with it."


  "Is it too late for the game, too?" Franny asked.

     "Listen, I said the hell with it. You're going to go back to your room at whosis—Blue
Shutters—and get some rest, that's the important thing," Lane said. He sat a trifle closer
to her and bent down and kissed her, briefly. He turned and looked over at the door, then
back at Franny. "You're just going to rest this afternoon. That's all you're going to do."
He stroked her arm for a moment. "Then maybe after a while, if you get any decent rest, I
can get upstairs somehow. I think there's a goddam back staircase. I can find out."

    Franny didn't say anything. She looked at the ceiling.

     "You know how long it's been?" Lane said. "When was that Friday night? Way the
hell early last month, wasn't it?" He shook his head. "That's no good. Too goddam long
between drinks. To put it crassly." He looked down at Franny more closely. "You really
feel better?"

    She nodded. She turned her head toward him. "I'm terribly thirsty, that's all. Do you
think I could have some water? Would it be too much trouble?"

      "Hell, no! Will you be all right if I leave you for a second? You know what I think
I'll do?"

    Franny shook her head to the second question.

     "I'll get somebody to bring you some water. Then I'll get the headwaiter and call off
the spirits of ammonia—and, incidentally, pay the check. Then I'll get a cab all ready, so
we won't have to hunt all around for one. It may take a few minutes, because most of
them will be cruising around for people going out to the game." He let go Franny's hand
and got up. "O.K.?" he said.

    "Fine."

    "O.K., I'll be right back. Don't move." He left the room.

    Alone, Franny lay quite still, looking at the ceiling. Her lips began to move, forming
soundless words, and they continued to move.




THE facts at hand presumably speak for themselves, but a trifle more vulgarly, I suspect,
than facts even usually do. As a counterbalance, then, we begin with that everfresh and
exciting odium: the author's formal introduction. The one I have in mind not only is
wordy and earnest beyond my wildest dreams but is, to boot, rather excruciatingly
personal. If, with the right kind of luck, it comes off, it should be comparable in effect to
a compulsory guided tour through the engine room, with myself, as guide, leading the
way in an old one-piece Jantzen bathing suit.
     To get straight to the worst, what I'm about to offer isn't really a short story at all but
a sort of prose home movie, and those who have seen the footage have strongly advised
me against nurturing any elaborate distribution plans for it. The dissenting group, it's my
privilege and headache to divulge, consists of the three featured players themselves, two
female, one male. We'll take the leading lady first, who, I believe, would prefer to be
briefly described as a languid, sophisticated type. She feels that things might have gone
along well enough if I'd just done
     boy will be seen reading an exceedingly lengthy letter (which will be reprinted here
in full, I can safely promise) sent to him by his eldest living brother, Buddy Glass. The
style of the letter, I'm told, bears a considerably more than passing resemblance to the
style, or written mannerisms, of this narrator, and the general reader will no doubt jump
to the heady conclusion that the writer of the letter and I are one and the same person.
Jump he will, and, I'm afraid, jump he should. We will, however, leave this Buddy Glass
in the third person from here on in. At least, I see no good reason to take him out of it.


TEN-THIRTY on a Monday morning in November of 1955, Zooey Glass, a young man
of twenty-five, was seated in a very full bath, reading a four-year-old letter. It was an
almost endless-looking letter, typewritten on several pages of second-sheet yellow paper,
and he was having some little trouble keeping it propped up against the two dry islands of
his knees. At his right, a dampish-looking cigarette was balanced on the edge of the built-
in enamel soapcatch, and evidently it was burning well enough, for every now and then
he picked it off and took a drag or two, without quite having to look up from his letter.
His ashes invariably fell into the tub water, either straightway or down one of the letter
pages. He seemed unaware of the mes-siness of the arrangement. He did seem aware,



though, if only just, that the heat of the water was beginning to have a dehydrating effect
on him. The longer he sat reading—or re-reading —the more often and the less absently
he used the back of his wrist to blot his forehead and upper lip.
     In Zooey, be assured early, we are dealing with the complex, the overlapping, the
cloven, and at least two dossier-like paragraphs ought to be got in right here. To start
with, he was a small young man, and extremely slight of body. From the rear—
particularly where his vertebrae were visible—he might almost have passed for one of
those needy metropolitan children who are sent out every summer to endowed camps to
be fattened and sunned. Close up, either full-face or in profile, he was surpassingly
handsome, even spectacularly so. His eldest sister (who modestly prefers to be identified
here as a Tuckahoe homemaker) has asked me to describe him as looking like "the blue-
eyed Jewish-Irish Mohican scout who died in your arms at the roulette table at Monte
Carlo." A more general and surely less parochial view was that his face had been just
barely saved from too-handsomeness, not to say gorgeousness, by virtue of one ear's
protruding slightly more than the other. I myself hold a very different opinion from either
of these. I submit that Zooey's face was close to being a wholly beautiful face. As such, it
was of course vulnerable to the same variety of glibly undaunted and usually specious
evaluations that any legitimate art object is. I think it just remains to be said that any one
of a hundred everyday menaces—a car accident, a head cold, a lie before breakfast—
could have disfigured or coarsened his bounteous good looks in a day or a second. But
what was undiminishable, and, as already so flatly suggested, a joy of a kind forever, was
an authentic esprit superimposed over his entire face—especially at the eyes, where it
was often as arresting as a Harlequin mask, and, on occasion, much more confounding.
      By profession, Zooey was an actor, a leading man, in television, and had been for a
little more than three years. He was, in fact, as "sought after" (and, according to vague
second-hand reports that reached his family, as highly paid) as a young leading man in
television perhaps can be who isn't at the same time a Hollywood or Broadway star with
a ready-made national reputation. But possibly either of these statements, without
elaboration, can lead to an overly clear-cut line of conjecture. As it happened, Zooey had
made a formal and serious debut as a public performer at the age of seven. He was the
second youngest of what had originally been seven brothers and sisters*—five boys and
two girls—all of whom, at rather conveniently spaced intervals during childhood, had
been heard regularly on a network radio program, a children's quiz show called "It's a
Wise Child." An age difference of almost eighteen years between the eldest of the Glass
children, Seymour, and the youngest, Franny, had helped very considerably to allow the
family to reserve a kind of dynastic seating arrangement at the "Wise Child"
microphones, which lasted just over sixteen years— from 1927 well into 1943, a span of
years connecting the Charleston and B-17 Eras. (All this data, I think, is to some degree
relevant.) For all the gaps and years between their individual heydays on the program, it
may be said (with few, and no really important, reservations) that all seven of the
children had managed to answer over the air a prodigious number of alternately deadly-
bookish and deadly-cute questions—sent in by listeners—with a freshness, an aplomb,
that was considered unique in commercial radio.
     * The aesthetic evil of a footnote seems in order just here, I'm afraid. In all that
follows, only the two youngest of the seven children will be directly seen or heard. The



remaining five, however, the senior five, will be stalking in and out of the plot with
considerable frequency, like so many Banquo's ghosts. The reader, then, may care to
know at the outset that in 1955 the eldest of the Glass children, Seymour, had been dead
almost seven years. He committed suicide while vacationing in Florida with his wife. If
alive, he would have been thirty-eight in 1955. The second-eldest child, Buddy, was what
is 'known in campus-catalogue parlance as "writer-in-residence" at a girls' junior college
in upper New York State. He lived alone, in a small, unwinterized, unelectrified house
about a quarter of a mile away from a rather popular ski-run. The next-eldest of the
children, Boo Boo, was married and the mother of three children. In November, 1955,
she was travelling in Europe with her husband and all three of their children. In order of
age, the twins, Walt and Waker, come after Boo Boo. Walt had been dead just over ten
years. He was killed in a freakish explosion while he was with the Army of Occupation in
Japan. Waker, his junior by some twelve minutes, was a Roman Catholic priest, and in
November, 1955, he was in Ecuador, attending a Jesuit conference of some kind.
     Public response to the children was often hot and never tepid. In general, listeners
were divided into two, curiously restive camps: those who held that the Glasses were a
bunch of insufferably "superior" little bastards that should have been drowned or gassed
at birth, and those who held that they were bona-fide underage wits and savants, of an
uncommon, if unenviable, order. At this writing (1957), there are former listeners to "It's
a Wise Child" who remember, with basically astonishing accuracy, many of the
individual performances of each of the seven children. In this same thinning but still
oddly coterielike group, the consensus is that, of all the Glass children, the eldest boy,
Seymour, back in the late twenties and early thirties, had been the "best" to hear, the most
consistently "rewarding." After Seymour, Zooey, the youngest boy in the family, is
generally placed second in order of preference, or appeal. And since we have a singularly
workaday interest in Zooey here, it may be appended that, as an ex-panelist on "It's a
Wise Child," he had one almanaclike distinction among (or over) his brothers and sisters.
Off and on, during their broadcasting years, all seven of the children had been fair game
for the kind of child psychologist or professional educator who takes a special interest in
extra-precocious children. In this cause, or service, Zooey had been, of all the Glasses,
hands down, the most voraciously examined, interviewed, and poked at. Very notably,
with no exceptions that I know of, his experiences in the apparently divergent fields of
clinical, social, and newsstand psychology had been costly for him, as though the places
where he was examined had been uniformly alive with either highly contagious traumas
or just plain old-fashioned germs. For example, in 1942 (with the everlasting disapproval
of his two eldest brothers, both of whom were in the Army at the time) he had been tested
by one research group alone, in Boston, on five separate occasions. (He was twelve
during most of the sessions, and it's possible that the train rides—ten of them—held some
attraction for him, at least in the beginning.) The main purpose of the five tests, one
gathered, was to isolate and study, if possible, the source of Zooey's precocious wit and
fancy. At the end of the fifth test, the subject was sent home to New York with three or
four aspirins in an engraved envelope for his sniffles, which turned out to be bronchial
pneumonia. Some six weeks later, a long-distance call came through from Boston at
eleven-thirty at night, with much dropping of small coins in an ordinary pay phone, and
an unidentified voice—with no intention, presumably, of sounding pedantically
waggish—informed Mr. and Mrs. Glass that their son Zooey, at twelve, had an English



vocabulary on an exact par with Mary Baker Eddy's, if he could be urged to use it.
     To resume: The long, typewritten, four-year-old letter that Zooey had checked into
the bathtub with, on this Monday morning in November, 1955, had obviously been taken
out of its envelope and unfolded and refolded on too many private occasions during the
four years, so that now it not only had an over-all unappetit-lich appearance but was
actually torn in several places, mostly along the creases. The author of the letter, as stated
earlier, was Zooey's eldest living brother, Buddy. The letter itself was virtually endless in
length, overwritten, teaching, repetitious, opinionated, remonstrative, condescending,
embarrassing—and filled, to a surfeit, with affection. In short, it was exactly the kind of
letter that a recipient, whether he wants to or not, carries around for some time in his hip
pocket. And that professional writers of a type love to reproduce verbatim:


    3/18/51
    DEAR ZOOEY,

      I've just finished decoding a long letter that came from Mother this morning, all
about you and General Eisenhower's smile and small boys in the Daily News who fall
down elevator shafts and when am I going to have my phone in New York taken out and
get one installed up here in the country, where I really need it. Surely the only woman in
the world who can write a letter in invisible italics. Dear Bessie. I get five hundred words
of copy from her like clockwork every three months on the subject of my poor old private
phone and how stupid it is to pay Good Money every month for something nobody's ever
even around to use any more. Which is really a big fat lie. When I'm in town, I invariably
sit talking by the hour with my old friend Yama, the God of Death, and a private phone's
a must for our little chats. Anyway, please tell her I haven't changed my mind. I love that
old phone with a passion. It was the only really private property Seymour and I ever had
in Bessie's entire kibbutz. It's also essential to my inner harmony to see Seymour's listing
in the goddam phone book every year. I like to browse through the G's confidently. Be a
good boy and pass that message along for me. Not quite word for word, but nicely. Be
kinder to Bessie, Zooey, when you can. I don't think I mean because she's our mother, but
because she's weary. You will after you're thirty or so, when everybody slows down a
little (even you, maybe), but try harder now. It isn't enough to treat her with the doting
brutality of an apache dancer toward his partner—which she understands, incidentally,
whether you think so or not. You forget that she thrives on sentimentality almost as much
as Les does.
      My telephone problems aside, Bessie's current letter is really a Zooey letter. I'm to
write and tell you that you have your Whole Life Before You and that it's Criminal if you
don't go after your Ph.D. before you go in for the actor's life in a big way. She doesn't say
what she'd like you to get the Ph.D. in, but I assume Math rather than Greek, you dirty
little bookworm. At any rate, I gather that she wants you to have something to Fall Back
On if for some reason the acting career doesn't work out. Which may be very sound, and
probably is, but I don't feel like coming right out and saying so. It happens to be one of
those days when I see everybody in the family, including myself, through the wrong end
of a telescope. I actually had to struggle at the mailbox this morning to know who Bessie
was when I saw her name on the return address of the envelope. For one good enough


reason, Advanced Writing 24-A loaded me up with thirty-eight short stories to drag
tearfully home for the weekend. Thirty-seven of them will be about a shy, reclusive
Pennsylvania Dutch lesbian who Wants To Write, told first-person by a lecherous hired
hand. In dialect.
     I take it for granted you know that for all the years I've been moving my literary
whore's cubicle from college to college, I still don't have even a B.A. It seems a century
ago, but I think there were two reasons, originally, why I didn't take a degree. (Just kindly
sit still. This is the first time I've written to you in years.) One, I was a proper snob in
college, as only an old Wise Child alumnus and future lifetime English-major can be, and
I didn't want any degrees if all the ill-read literates and radio announcers and pedagogical
dummies I knew had them by the peck. And, two, Seymour had his Ph.D. at an age when
most young Americans are just getting out of high school, and since it was too late for me
to catch up with him in style, I wasn't having any. Of course, too, I knew for certain when
I was your age that I'd never be forced to teach, that if my Muses failed to provide for me,
I'd go grind lenses somewhere, like Booker T. Washington. In any particular sense,
though, I don't think I have any academic regrets. On especially black days I sometimes
tell myself that if I'd loaded up with degrees when I was able, I might not now be
teaching anything quite so collegiate and hopeless as Advanced Writing 24-A. But that's
probably bunk. The cards are stacked (quite properly, I imagine) against all professional
aesthetes, and no doubt we all deserve the dark, wordy, academic deaths we all sooner or
later die.
     I do think your case is a lot different from mine. Anyway, I don't think I'm really on
Bessie's side. If it's Security you want, or that Bessie wants for you, your M.A. will at
least always qualify you to pass out logarithm tables at any dreary boys' prep school in
the country, and most colleges. On the other hand, your beautiful Greek will do you
almost no good at all on any good-size campus unless you have a Ph.D., living as we do
in a brass-hat, brass-mortarboard world. (Of course, you can always move to Athens.
Sunny old Athens.) But the more I think of it, the more I think to hell with more degrees
for you. The fact is, if you want to know, I can't help thinking you'd make a damn site
better-adjusted actor if Seymour and I hadn't thrown in the Upanishads and the Diamond
Sutra and Eckhart and all our other old loves with the rest of your recommended home
reading when you were small. By rights, an actor should travel fairly light. When we
were kids, S. and I once had a beautiful lunch with John Barrymore. He was bright as
hell, and full of lore, but he wasn't burdened down with any of the cumbersome luggage
of a too formal education. I mention this because I was talking to a rather pompous
Orientalist over the weekend, and at one point, during a very deep, metaphysical lull in
the conversation, I told him I had a little brother who once got over an unhappy love
affair by trying to translate the Mundaka Upanishad into classical Greek. (He laughed
uproariously—you know the way Orientalists laugh.)
     I wish to God I had some idea what will happen to you as an actor. You're a born
one, certainly. Even our Bessie knows that. And surely you and Franny are the only
beauties in the family. But where will you act? Have you thought about it? The movies?
If so, I'm scared stiff that if ever you gain any weight you'll be as victimized as the next
young actor into contributing to the reliable Hollywood amalgam of prizefighter and
mystic, gunman and underprivileged child, cowhand and Man's Conscience, and the rest.


Will you be content with that standard box-office schmalz? Or will you dream of
something a little more cosmic—zum Beispiel, playing Pierre or Andrey in a Technicolor
production of War and Peace, with stunning battlefield scenes, and all the nuances of
characterization left out (on the ground that they're novel-istic and unphotogenic), and
Anna Magnani daringly cast as Natasha (just to keep the production classy and Honest),
and gorgeous incidental music by Dmitri Popkin, and all the male leads intermittently
rippling their jaw muscles to show they're under great emotional stress, and a World
Premiere at the Winter Garden, under floodlights, with Molotov and Milton Berle and
Governor Dewey introducing the celebrities as they come into the theatre. (By celebrities
I mean, of course, old Tolstoy-lovers —Senator Dirksen, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Gayelord
Hauser, Georgie Jessel, Charles of the Ritz.) How does that sound? And if you go into the
theatre, will you have any illusions about that? Have you ever seen a really beautiful
production of, say, The Cherry Orchard? Don't say you have. Nobody has. You may have
seen "inspired" productions, "competent" productions, but never anything beautiful.
Never one where Chekhov's talent is matched, nuance for nuance, idiosyncrasy for
idiosyncrasy, by every soul onstage. You worry hell out of me, Zooey. Forgive the
pessimism, if not the sonority. But I know how much you demand from a thing, you little
bastard. And I've had the hellish experience of sitting next to you at the theatre. I can so
clearly see you demanding something from the performing arts that just isn't residual
there. For heaven's sake, be careful.
     Granted I'm off today. I keep a good neurotic's calendar, and it's three years, to the
day, since Seymour killed himself. Did I ever tell you what happened when I went down
to Florida to bring back the body? I wept like a slob on the plane for five solid hours.
Carefully adjusting my veil from time to time so that no one across the aisle could see
me—I had a seat to myself, thank God. About five minutes before the plane landed, I
became aware of people talking in the seat behind me. A woman was saying, with all of
Back Bay Boston and most of Harvard Square in her voice, ". . . and the next morning,
mind you, they took a pint of pus out of that lovely young body of hers." That's all I
remember hearing, but when I got off the plane a few minutes later and the Bereaved
Widow came toward me all in Bergdorf Goodman black, I had the Wrong Expression on
my face. I was grinning. Which is exactly the way I feel today, for no really good reason.
Against my better judgment, I feel certain that somewhere very near here—the first house
down the road, maybe—there's a good poet dying, but also somewhere very near here
somebody's having a hilarious pint of pus taken from her lovely young body, and I can't
be running back and forth forever between grief and high delight.
     Last month, Dean Sheeter (whose name usually transports Franny when I mention it)
approached me with his gracious smile and bull whip, and I am now lecturing to the
faculty, their wives, and a few oppressively deep-type undergraduates every Friday on
Zen and Ma-hayana Buddhism. A feat, I haven't a doubt, that will eventually win me the
Eastern Philosophy Chair in Hell. The point is, I'm now on the campus five days a week
instead of four, and what with my own work at nights and on weekends, I have almost no
time to do any elective thinking. Which is my plaintive way of saying that I do worry
about you and Franny when I get a chance, but not nearly so often as I'd like to. What I'm
really trying to tell you is. that Bessie's letter had very little to do with my sitting down in
a sea of ashtrays to write to you today. She shoots me some priority information about
you and Franny every week and I never do anything about it, so it isn't that. What brings


this on is something that happened to me at the local supermarket today. (No new
paragraph. I'll spare you that.) I was standing at the meat counter, waiting for some rib
lamb chops to be cut. A young mother and her little girl were waiting around, too. The
little girl was about four, and, to pass the time, she leaned her back against the glass
showcase and stared up at my unshaven face. I told her she was about the prettiest little
girl I'd seen all day. Which made sense to her; she nodded. I said I'd bet she had a lot of
boy friends. I got the same nod again. I asked her how many boy friends she had. She
held up two fingers. "Two!" I said. "That's a lot of boy friends. What are their names,
sweetheart?" Said she, in a piercing voice, "Bobby and Dorothy." I grabbed my lamb
chops and ran. But that's exactly what brought on this letter—much more than Bessie's
insistence that I write to you about Ph.D.s and acting. That, and a haiku-style poem I
found in the hotel room where Seymour shot himself. It was written in pencil on the desk
blotter: "The little girl on the plane/ Who turned her doll's head around/ To look at me."
With these two things on my mind, I thought as I was driving home from the supermarket
that at long last I could write to you and tell you why S. and I took over your and Franny's
education as early and as highhandedly as we did. We've never put it into words for you,
and I think it's high time one of us did. But now I'm not so sure I can do it. The little girl
at the meat counter is gone, and I can't quite see the polite face of the little doll on the
plane. And the old horror of being a professional writer, and the usual stench of words
that goes with it, is beginning to drive me out of my seat. It seems terribly important to
try, though.
     The age differences in the family always seemed to add unnecessarily and perversely
to our problems. Not really between S. and the twins and Boo Boo and me, but between
the two twosomes of you and Franny and S. and me. Seymour and I were both adults—he
was even long out of college—by the time you and Franny were both able to read. At that
stage, we had no real urge even to push our favorite classics at the two of you—not,
anyway, with the same gusto that we had at the twins or Boo Boo. We knew there's no
keeping a born scholar ignorant, and at heart, I think, we didn't really want to, but we
were nervous, even frightened, at the statistics on child pedants and academic
weisenheimers who grow up into faculty-recreation-room savants. Much, much more
important, though, Seymour had already begun to believe (and I agreed with him, as far
as I was able to see the point) that education by any name would smell as sweet, and
maybe much sweeter, if it didn't begin with a quest for knowledge at all but with a quest,
as Zen would put it, for no-knowledge. Dr. Suzuki says somewhere that to be in a state of
pure consciousness—satori—is to be with God before he said, Let there be light.
Seymour and I thought it might be a good thing to hold back this light from you and
Franny (at least as far as we were able), and all the many lower, more fashionable
lighting effects—the arts, sciences, classics, languages—till you were both able at least to
conceive of a state of being where the mind knows the source of all light. We thought it
would be wonderfully constructive to at least (that is, if our own "limitations" got in the
way) tell you as much as we knew about the men—the saints, the arhats, the bodhisattvas,
the jivanmuktas—who knew something or everything about this state of being. That is,
we wanted you both to know who and what Jesus and Gautama and Lao-tse and Shan-
karacharya and Hui-neng and Sri Ramakrishna, etc., were before you knew too much or
anything about Homer or Shakespeare or even Blake or Whitman, let alone George
Washington and his cherry tree or the definition of a peninsula or how to parse a

sentence. That, anyway, was the big idea. Along with all this, I suppose I'm trying to say
that I know how bitterly you resent the years when S. and I were regularly conducting
home seminars, and the metaphysical sittings in particular. I just hope that one day—
preferably when we're both blind drunk—we can talk about it. (Meantime, I can only say
that neither Seymour nor I ever had a notion, that far back, that you were going to grow
up into an actor. We should have, no doubt, but we didn't. If we had, I feel certain S.
would have tried to do something constructive about it. Surely somewhere there must be
a special prep course for Nirvana and points East designed strictly for actors, and I think
S. would have found it.) The paragraph should close, but I can't stop muttering. You'll
wince at what comes next, but come it must. I think you know that I had the best
intentions of checking in now and then after S.'s death to see how you and Franny were
holding up. You were eighteen, and I didn't worry about you overly. Although I did hear
from a gossipy little snip in one of my classes that you had a reputation in your college
dorm for going off and sitting in meditation for ten hours at a time, and that made me
think. But Franny was thirteen at the time. I simply couldn't move, though. I was afraid to
come home. I wasn't afraid you'd both, in tears, take up a position across the room and
fire the complete set of Max Mueller's Sacred Books of the East at me, one by one.
(Which would have been masochistic ecstasy for me, probably.) But I was afraid of the
questions (much more than the accusations) you might both put to me. As I remember
very well, I let a whole year go by after the funeral before I came back to New York at
all. After that, it was easy enough to come in for birthdays and holidays and be
reasonably sure that questions would run to when my next book would be finished and
had I done any skiing lately, etc. You've even both been up here on many a weekend in
the last couple of years, and though we've talked and talked and talked, we've all agreed
not to say a word. Today is the first time I've really wanted to speak up. The deeper I get
into this goddam letter, the more I lose the courage of my convictions. But I swear to you
that I had a perfectly communicable little vision of truth (lamb-chop division) this
afternoon the very instant that child told me her boy friends' names were Bobby and
Dorothy. Seymour once said to me—in a crosstown bus, of all places— that all legitimate
religious study must lead to unlearning the differences, the illusory differences, between
boys and girls, animals and stones, day and night, heat and cold. That suddenly hit me at
the meat counter, and it seemed a matter of life and death to drive home at seventy miles
an hour to get a letter off to you. Oh, God, how I wish I'd grabbed a pencil right there in
the supermarket and not trusted the roads home. Maybe it's just as well, though. There are
times when I think you've forgiven S. more completely than any of us have. Waker once
said something very interesting to me on that subject—in fact, I'm merely parroting what
he said to me. He said you were the only one who was bitter about S.'s suicide and the
only one who really forgave him for it. The rest of us, he said, were outwardly unbitter
and inwardly unforgiving. That may be truer than true. How can I know? All I do know
for certain is that I had something happy and exciting to tell you—and on just one side of
the paper, doublespaced—and I knew when I got home that it was mostly gone, or all
gone, and there was nothing left to do but go through the motions. Lecture you on Ph.D.s
and the actor's life. How messy, how funny, and how Seymour himself would have
smiled and smiled—and probably assured me, and all of us, not to worry about it.
   Enough. Act, Zachary Martin Glass, when and where you want to, since you feel you
must, but do it with all your might. If you do anything at all beautiful on a stage, anything

nameless and joy-making, anything above and beyond the call of theatrical ingenuity, S.
and I will both rent tuxedos and rhinestone hats and solemnly come around to the stage
door with bouquets of snapdragons. In any case, for what little it's worth, please count on
my affection and support, at whatever distance.
    --BUDDY
     As always, my passes at omniscience are absurd, but you, of all people, should be
polite to the part of me that comes out merely clever. Years ago, in my earliest and
pastiest days as a would-be writer, I once read a new story aloud to S. and Boo Boo.
When I was finished, Boo Boo said flatly (but looking over at Seymour) that the story
was "too clever." S. shook his head, beaming away at me, and said cleverness was my
permanent affliction, my wooden leg, and that it was in the worst possible taste to draw
the group's attention to it. As one limping man to another, old Zooey, let's be courteous
and kind to each other.
    Much love, B.



THE last, the under, page of the four-year-old letter was stained a sort of off-cordovan
color, and it was torn in two places along the folds. Zooey, finished reading, treated it
with some little care as he put the letter back into page-one order. He tapped the pages, to
even them out, against his dry knees. He frowned. Then, mercurially, as though he'd read
the letter, by God, for the last time in his life, he stuffed it like so much excelsior into its
envelope. He placed the thick envelope on the side of the tub and began to play a little
game with it. With one finger he tapped the loaded envelope back and forth along the tub
edge, seeing, apparently, if he could keep it in motion without letting it fall into the tub
water. After a good five minutes of this, he gave the envelope a faulty tap and had to
reach out quickly and grab it. Which ended the game. Keeping the retrieved envelope in
his hand, he sat lower, deeper, in the water, letting his knees submerge. He stared
abstractedly for a minute or two at the tiled wall beyond the foot of the tub, then glanced
at his cigarette on the soapcatch, picked it off, and took a couple of test drags on it, but it
had gone out. He sat up again, very abruptly, with a great slosh of tub water, and dropped
his dry left hand over the side of the tub. A typewritten manuscript was lying, face up, on
the bathmat. He picked it up and brought it aboard, as it were. He stared at it briefly, then
inserted his four-year-old letter in the middle pages, where the stapling in a manuscript is
tightest. He then propped the manuscript against his now wet knees, an inch or so above
the waterline, and began to turn the pages. When he came to page 9, he folded the
manuscript, magazine-style, and began to read or to study.
    The role of "Rick" had been heavily underlined with a soft-lead pencil.


    TINA (morosely):   Oh, darling, darling, darling. I'm not much good to you, am I?
    RICK: Don't   say that. Don't ever say that, you hear me?
    TINA: It's true, though. I'm a jinx. I'm a horrible jinx. If it hadn't been for me, Scott
Kincaid would have assigned you to the Buenos Aires office ages ago. I spoiled all that.



(Goes over to window) I'm one of the little foxes that spoil the grapes. I feel like someone
in a terribly sophisticated play. The funny part is, I'm not sophisticated. I'm not anything.
I'm just me. (Turns) Oh, Rick, Rick, I'm scared. What's happened to us? I can't seem to
find us anymore. I reach out and reach out and we're just not there. I'm frightened. I'm a
frightened child. (Looks out window) I hate this rain. Sometimes I see me dead in it.
    RICK (quietly):   My darling, isn't that a line from "A Farewell to Arms"?
     TINA (Turns, furious): Get out of here. Get out! Get out of here before I jump out of
this window. Do you hear me?
    RICK (grabbing her): Now you listen to me. You beautiful little moron. You
adorable, childish, self-dramatizing—


     Zooey's reading was suddenly interrupted by his mother's voice—importunate, quasi-
constructive—addressing him from outside the bathroom door: "Zooey? Are you still in
the tub?"
    "Yes, I'm still in the tub. Why?"
    "I want to come in for just a teeny minute. I have something for you."
    "I'm in the tub, for God's sake, Mother."
    "I'll just be a minute, for goodness' sake. Pull the shower curtain."
     Zooey took a parting look at the page he had been reading, then closed the
manuscript and dropped it over the side of the tub. "Jesus Christ almighty," he said.
"Sometimes I see me dead in the rain." A nylon shower curtain, scarlet, with a design of
canary-yellow sharps, flats, and clefs on it, was bunched up at the foot of the tub,
attached with plastic rings to an overhead chromium bar. Sitting forward, Zooey reached
for it and shot it the length of the tub, closing himself off from view. "All right. God.
Come in if you're coming in," he said. His voice had no conspicuous actor's mannerisms,
but it was rather excessively vibrant; it "carried" implacably when he had no interest in
controlling it. Years earlier, as a child panelist on "It's a Wise Child," he had been
advised repeatedly to keep his distance from the microphone.
     The door opened, and Mrs. Glass, a medium-stout woman in a hairnet, sidled into the
bathroom. Her age, under any circumstance, was fiercely indeterminate, but never more
so than when she was wearing a hairnet. Her entrances into rooms were usually verbal as
well as physical. "I don't know how you can stay in the tub the way you do." She closed
the door behind her instantly, as someone does who has been waging a long, long war on
behalf of her progeny against post-bath drafts. "It isn't even healthy," she said.
    "Do you know how long you've been in that tub? Exactly forty-five—"
   "Don't tell me! Just don't tell me, Bessie." "What do you mean, don't tell you?" "Just
what I said. Leave me the goddam illusion you haven't been out there counting the
minutes I've—"
     "Nobody's been counting any minutes, young man," Mrs. Glass said. She was
already very busy. She had brought into the bathroom a small, oblong package wrapped

in white paper and tied with gold tinsel. It appeared to contain an object roughly the size
of the Hope diamond or an irrigation attachment. Mrs. Glass narrowed her eyes at it and
picked at the tinsel with her fingers. When the knot didn't give, she applied her teeth to it.
     She was wearing her usual at-home vesture— what her son Buddy (who was a
writer, and consequently, as Kafka, no less, has told us, not a nice man) called her pre-
notification-of-death uniform. It consisted mostly of a hoary midnight-blue Japanese
kimono. She almost invariably wore it throughout the apartment during the day. With its
many occultish-looking folds, it also served as the repository for the paraphernalia of a
very heavy cigarette smoker and an amateur handyman; two oversized pockets had been
added at the hips, and they usually contained two or three packs of cigarettes, several
match folders, a screwdriver, a claw-end hammer, a Boy Scout knife that had once
belonged to one of her sons, and an enamel faucet handle or two, plus an assortment of
screws, nails, hinges, and ball-bearing casters—all of which tended to make Mrs. Glass
chink faintly as she moved about in her large apartment. For ten years or more, both of
her daughters had often, if impo-tently, conspired to throw out this veteran kimono. (Her
married daughter, Boo Boo, had intimated that it might have to be given a coup de grace
with a blunt instrument before it was laid away in a wastebasket.) However Oriental the
wrapper had originally been designed to look, it didn't detract an iota from the single,
impactful impression that Mrs. Glass, chez elle, made on a certain type of observer. The
Glasses lived in an old but, categorically, not unfashionable apartment house in the East
Seventies, where possibly two-thirds of the more mature women tenants owned fur coats
and, on leaving the building on a bright weekday morning, might at least conceivably be
found, a half hour or so later, getting in or out of one of the elevators at Lord & Taylor's
or Saks or Bonwit Teller's. In this distinctly Manhattanesque locale, Mrs. Glass was
(from an undeniably hoyden point of view) a rather refreshing eyesore. She looked, first,
as if she never, never left the building at all, but that if she did, she would be wearing a
dark shawl and she would be going in the general direction of O'Connell Street, there to
claim the body of one of her half-Irish, half-Jewish sons, who, through some clerical
error, had just been shot dead by the Black and Tans.
     Zooey's voice suddenly and suspiciously spoke up: "Mother? What in Christ's name
are you doing out there?"
     Mrs. Glass had undressed the package and now stood reading the fine print on the
back of a carton of toothpaste. "Just kindly button that lip of yours," she said, rather
absently. She went over to the medicine cabinet. It was stationed above the washbowl,
against the wall. She opened its mirror-faced door and surveyed the congested shelves
with the eye—or, rather, the masterly squint—of a dedicated medicine-cabinet gardener.
Before her, in overly luxuriant rows, was a host, so to speak, of golden pharmaceuticals,
plus a few technically less indigenous whatnots. The shelves bore iodine,
Mercurochrome, vitamin capsules, dental floss, aspirin, Anacin, Bufferin, Argyrol,
Musterole, Ex-Lax, Milk of Magnesia, Sal Hepatica, Aspergum, two Gillette razors, one
Schick Injector razor, two tubes of shaving cream, a bent and somewhat torn snapshot of
a fat black-and-white cat asleep on a porch railing, three combs, two hairbrushes, a bottle
of Wildroot hair ointment, a bottle of Fitch Dandruff Remover, a small, unlabelled box of
glycerine suppositories, Vicks Nose Drops, Vicks VapoRub, six bars of castile soap, the
stubs of three tickets to a 1946 musical comedy ("Call Me Mister"), a tube of depilatory



cream, a box of Kleenex, two seashells, an assortment of used-looking emery boards, two
jars of cleansing cream, three pairs o£ scissors, a nail file, an unclouded blue marble
(known to marble shooters, at least in the twenties, as a "purey"), a cream for contracting
enlarged pores, a pair of tweezers, the strapless chassis of a girl's or woman's gold
wristwatch, a box of bicarbonate of soda, a girl's boarding-school class ring with a
chipped onyx stone, a bottle of Stopette—and, inconceivably or no, quite a good deal
more. Mrs. Glass briskly reached up and took down an object from the bottom shelf and
dropped it, with a muffled, tinny bang, into the wastebasket. "I'm putting some of that
new toothpaste they're all raving about in here for you," she announced, without turning
around, and made good her word. "I want you to stop using that crazy powder. It's going
to take all the lovely enamel off your teeth. You have lovely teeth. The least you can do
is take proper—"
   "Who said so?" A sound of agitated tub water came from behind the shower curtain.
"Who the hell said it's going to take all the lovely enamel off my teeth?"
     "I did." Mrs. Glass gave her garden a final critical glance. "Just please use it." She
nudged an unopened box of Sal Hepatica a little with the trowel of her extended fingers
to align it with the other sempervirents in its row, and then closed the cabinet door. She
turned on the cold-water tap. "I'd like to know who washes their hands and then doesn't
clean the bowl up after them," she said grimly. "This is supposed to be a family of all
adults." She increased the pressure of the water and cleansed the bowl briefly but
thoroughly with one hand. "I don't suppose you've spoken to your little sister yet," she
said, and turned to look at the shower curtain.
   "No, I have not spoken to my little sister yet. How 'bout getting the hell out of here
now?"
    "Why haven't you?" Mrs. Glass demanded. "I don't think that's nice, Zooey. I don't
think that's nice at all. I asked you particularly to please go see if there's anything—"
     "In the first place, Bessie, I just got up about an hour ago. In the second place, I
talked to her for two solid hours last night, and I don't think she frankly wants to talk to
any goddam one of us today. And in the third place, if you don't get out of this bathroom
I'm going to set fire to this ugly goddam curtain. I mean it, Bessie."
     Somewhere in the middle of these three illustrative points, Mrs. Glass had left off
listening and sat down. "Sometimes I could almost murder Buddy for not having a
phone," she said. "It's so unnecessary. How can a grown man live like that—no phone, no
anything? No one has any desire to invade his privacy, if that's what he wants, but I
certainly don't think it's necessary to live like a hermit." She stirred irritably, and crossed
her legs. "It isn't even safe, for heaven's sake! Suppose he broke his leg or something like
that. Way off in the woods like that. I worry about it all the time."
    "You do, eh? Which do you worry about? His breaking a leg or his not having a
phone when you want him to?"
    "I worry about both, young man, for your information."
    "Well... don't. Don't waste your time. You're so stupid, Bessie. Why are you so
stupid? You know Buddy, for God's sake. If he were twenty miles in the woods, with
both legs broken and a goddam arrow sticking out of his back, he'd crawl back to his



cave just to make certain nobody sneaked in to try on his galoshes while he was out." A
short, pleasurable, if somewhat ghoulish, guffaw sounded behind the curtain. "Take my
word for it. He cares too much about his goddam privacy to die in any woods."
     "Nobody said anything about dying," Mrs. Glass said. She gave her hairnet a minor
and needless adjustment. "I've been trying the whole entire morning to get those people
that live down the road from him on the phone. They don't even answer. It's infuriating
not to be able to get him. How many times I've begged him to take that crazy phone out
of his and Seymour's old room. It isn't even normal. When something really comes up
and he needs one— It's infuriating. I tried twice last night, and about four times this—"
   "What's all this 'infuriating' business? In the first place, why should some strangers
down the road be at our beck and call?"
     "Nobody's talking about anybody being at our beck and call, Zooey. Just don't be so
fresh, please. For your information, I'm very worried about that child. And I think Buddy
should be told about this whole thing. Just for your information, I don't think he'd ever
forgive me if I didn't get in touch with him at a time like this."
    "All right, then! Why don't you call the college, instead of bothering his neighbors?
He wouldn't be in his cave anyway at this time of day—you know that."
     "Just kindly lower that voice of yours, please, young man. Nobody's deaf. For your
information, I have called the college. I've learned from experience that that does
absolutely no good whatsoever. They just leave messages on his desk, and I don't think
he ever goes anywhere near his office anyway." Mrs. Glass abruptly leaned her weight
forward, without getting up, and reached out and picked up something from the top of the
laundry hamper. "Do you have a washrag back there?" she asked.
     "The word is 'washcloth,' not 'washrag,' and all I want, God damn it, Bessie, is to be
left alone in this bathroom. That's my one simple desire. If I'd wanted this place to fill up
with every fat Irish rose that passes by, I'd've said so. Now, c'mon. Get out."
    "Zooey," Mrs. Glass said patiently. "I'm holding a clean washrag in my hand. Do
you or don't you want it? Just yes or no, please."
    "Oh, my God! Yes. Yes. Yes. More than anything in the world. Throw it over."
    "I won't throw it over, I'll hand it to you. Al ways throw everything, in this family."
Mrs. Glass got up, took three steps over to the shower curtain, and waited for a
disembodied hand to claim the washcloth.
    "Thanks a million. Clear out of here now, please. I've lost about ten pounds already."
     "It's no wonder! You sit there in that tub till you're practically blue in the face, and
then you —What's this?" With immense interest, Mrs. Glass bent down and picked up the
manuscript Zooey had been reading before she made her entrance into the room. "Is this
the new script Mr. LeSage sent over?" she asked. "On the floor?" She didn't get an
answer. It was as if Eve had asked Cain whether that wasn't his lovely new hoe lying out
there in the rain. "That's a marvellous place to put a manuscript, I must say." She
transported the manuscript over to the window and placed it with care on the radiator.
She looked down at it, appearing to inspect it for wetness. The window blind had been
lowered— Zooey had done all his bathtub reading by the light from the three-bulb



overhead fixture—but a fraction of morning light inched under the blind and onto the title
page of the manuscript. Mrs. Glass tilted her head to one side, the better to read the title,
at the same time taking a pack of king-size cigarettes from her kimono pocket."'The Heart
Is an Autumn Wanderer,'" she read, mused, aloud. "Unusual title."
    The response from behind the shower curtain was a trifle delayed but delighted. "It's
a what? It's a what kind of title?"
    Mrs. Glass's guard was already up. She backed up and re-seated herself, a lighted
cigarette in her hand. "Unusual, I said. I didn't say it was beautiful or anything, so just—"
     "Ahh, by George. You have to get up pretty early in the morning to get anything
really classy past you, Bessie girl. You know what your heart is, Bessie? Would you like
to know what your heart is? Your heart, Bessie, is an autumn garage. How's that for a
catchy title, eh? By God, many people—many uninformed people—think Seymour and
Buddy are the only goddam men of letters in this family. When I think, when I sit down
for a minute and think of the sensitive prose, and garages, I throw away every day of
my—"
     "All right, all right, young man," Mrs. Glass said. Whatever her taste in television-
play titles, or her aesthetics in general, a flicker came into her eyes—no more than a
flicker, but a flicker— of connoisseurlike, if perverse, relish for her youngest, and only
handsome, son's style of bullying. For a split second, it displaced the look of all-round
wear and, plainly, specific worry that had been on her face since she entered the
bathroom. However, she was almost immediately back on the defensive: "What's the
matter with that title? It is very unusual. You! You don't think anything's unusual or
beautifull I've never once heard you—"
     "What? Who doesn't? Exactly what don't I think isn't beautiful?" A minor
groundswell sounded behind the shower curtain, as though a rather delinquent porpoise
were suddenly at play. "Listen, I don't care what you say about my race, creed, or
religion, Fatty, but don't tell me I'm not sensitive to beauty. That's my Achilles' heel, and
don't you forget it. To me, everything is beautiful. Show me a pink sunset and I'm limp,
by God. Anything. 'Peter Pan.' Even before the curtain goes up at 'Peter Pan,' I'm a
goddam puddle of tears. And you have the gall to try to tell me I'm—"
     "Oh, shut up," Mrs. Glass said, absently. She gave a great sigh. Then, with a tense
expression, she dragged deeply on her cigarette and, exhaling the smoke through her
nostrils, said— or, rather, erupted—"Oh, I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do with that
child!" She took a deep breath. "I'm absolutely at the end of my rope." She gave the
shower curtain an X-ray-like look. "You're none of you any help whatsoever. But none!
Your father doesn't even like to talk about anything like this. You know that! He's
worried, too, naturally—I know that look on his face—but he simply will not face
anything." Mrs. Glass's mouth tightened. "He's never faced anything as long as I've
known him. He thinks anything peculiar or unpleasant will just go away if he turns on the
radio and some little schnook starts singing."
     A great single roar of laughter came from the closed-off Zooey. It was scarcely
distinguishable from his guffaw, but there was a difference.
    "Well, he does!" Mrs. Glass insisted, humorlessly. She sat forward. "Would you like



to know what I honestly think?" she demanded. "Would you?"
      "Bessie. For God's sake. You're going to tell me anyway, so what's the difference if
I—"
      "I honestly think—I mean this, now—I honestly think he keeps hoping to hear all
you children on the radio again. I'm serious, now." Mrs. Glass took another deep breath.
"Every single time your father turns on the radio, I honestly think he expects to tune in on
'It's a Wise Child* and hear all you children, one by one, answering questions again." She
compressed her lips and paused, unconsciously, for additional emphasis. "And I mean all
of you," she said, and abruptly straightened her posture a trifle. "That includes Seymour
and Walt." She took a brisk but voluminous drag on her cigarette. "He lives entirely in
the past. But entirely. He hardly ever even watches television, unless you're on. And don't
laugh, Zooey. It isn't funny."
      "Who in God's name is laughing?"
    "Well, it's true! He has absolutely no conception of anything being really wrong with
Franny. But none! Right after the eleven-o'clock news last night, what do you think he
asks me? If I think Franny might like a tangerine! The child's laying there by the hour
crying her eyes out if you say boo to her, and mumbling heaven knows what to herself,
and your father wonders if maybe she'd like a tangerine. I could've killed him. The next
time he—" Mrs. Glass broke off. She glared at the shower curtain. "What's so funny?"
she demanded.
     "Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. I like the tangerine. All right, who else is being
no help to you? Me. Les. Buddy. Who else? Pour your heart out to me, Bessie. Don't be
reticent. That's the whole trouble with this family—we keep things bottled up too much."
     "Oh, you're about as funny as a crutch, young man," Mrs. Glass said. She took time
to push a stray wisp of hair under the elastic of her hairnet. "Oh, I wish I could get Buddy
on that crazy phone for a few minutes. The one person that's supposed to know about all
this funny business." She reflected, with apparent rancor. "It never rains but it pours." She
tapped her cigarette ash into her cupped left hand. "Boo Boo won't be back till the tenth.
Waker I'd be afraid to tell about it, even if I knew how to get hold of him. I never saw a
family like this in my entire life. I mean it. You're all supposed to be so intelligent and
everything, all you children, and not one of you is any help when the chips are down. Not
one of you. I'm just a little bit sick of—"
    "What chips, for God's sake? When what chips are down? What would you like us to
do, Bessie? Go in there and live Franny's life for her?"
     "Now, just stop that! Nobody's talking about anybody living her life for her. I'd
simply like somebody to go in that living room and find out what's what,--that's what I'd
like. I'd like to know just when that child intends to go back to college and finish her
year. I'd like to know just when she intends to put something halfway nourishing into her
stomach. She's eaten practically nothing since she got home Saturday night —but
nothing! I tried—not a half hour ago—to get her to take a nice cup of chicken broth. She
took exactly two mouthfuls, and that's all. She threw up everything I got her to eat
yesterday, practically." Mrs. Glass's voice stopped only long enough to reload, as it were.
"She said maybe she'd eat a cheeseburger later on. Just what is this cheeseburger

business? From what I gather, she's practically been living on cheeseburgers and Cokes
all semester so far. Is that what they feed a young girl at college these days? I know one
thing. I'm certainly not going to feed a young girl that's as run-down as that child is on
food that isn't even—"
     "That's the spirit! Make it chicken broth or nothing. That's putting the ole foot down.
If she's determined to have a nervous breakdown, the least we can do is see that she
doesn't have it in peace."
     "Just don't you be so fresh, young man—Oh, that mouth of yours! For your
information, I don't think it's at all impossible that the kind of food that child takes into
her system hasn't a lot to do with this whole entire funny business. Even as a child you
practically had to force that child to even touch her vegetables or any of the things that
were good for her. You can't go on abusing the body indefinitely, year in, year out —
regardless of what you think."
     "You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. It's staggering how you jump
straight the hell into the heart of a matter. I'm goosebumps all over... By God, you inspire
me. You inflame me, Bessie. You know what you've done? Do you realize what you've
done? You've given this whole goddam issue a fresh, new, Biblical slant. I wrote four
papers in college on the Crucifixion —five, really—and every one of them worried me
half crazy because I thought something was missing. Now I know what it was. Now it's
clear to me. I see Christ in an entirely different light. His unhealthy fanaticism. His
rudeness to those nice, sane, conservative, tax-paying Pharisees. Oh, this is exciting! In
your simple, straightforward, bigoted way, Bessie, you've sounded the missing keynote of
the whole New Testament. Improper diet. Christ lived on cheeseburgers and Cokes. For
all we know, he probably fed the mult—"
     "Just stop that, now" Mrs. Glass broke in, her voice quiet but dangerous. "Oh, I'd
like to put a diaper on that mouth of yours!"
    "Well, gee whizz. I'm only trying to make polite bathroom talk."
     "You're so funny. Oh, you're so funny! It just so happens, young man, that I don't
consider your little sister in exactly the exact same light that I do the Lord. I may be
peculiar, but I don't happen to. I don't happen to see any comparison whatsoever between
the Lord and a rundown, overwrought little college girl that's been reading too many
religious books and all like that! You certainly know your sister as well as I do—or
should. She's terribly impressionable and always has been, and you know it very well!"
    The bathroom was oddly still for a moment.
     "Mother? Are you sitting down out there? I have a terrible feeling you're sitting
down out there with about five cigarettes going. Are you?" He waited. Mrs. Glass,
however, didn't choose to reply. "I don't want you sitting down out there, Bessie. I'd like
to get out of this God-damned tub. . . . Bessie? You hear me?"
     "I hear you, I hear you," Mrs. Glass said. A fresh wave of worry had passed over her
face. She straightened her back restively. "She's got that crazy Bloomberg in bed with her
on the couch," she said. "It isn't even healthy." She gave a mighty sigh. For several
minutes she had been holding her cigarette ashes in her cupped left hand. She now
reached over, without quite having to get up, and emptied them into the wastebasket. "I



don't know what I'm supposed to do," she announced, "I just don't, that's all. The house is
absolutely upside down. The painters are almost finished in her room, and they're going
to want to get in the living room immediately after lunch. I don't know whether to wake
her up, or what. She's had almost no sleep. I'm simply losing my mind. Do you know how
long it's been since I've even been free to have the painters in this apartment? Nearly
twen—"
    "The painters! Ah! The dawn comes up. I forgot all about the painters. Listen, why
haven't you asked them in here? There's plenty of room. What the hell kind of host will
they think I am, not asking them into the bathroom when I'm—"
    "Just be quiet a minute, young man. I'm thinking."
     As if in obedience, Zooey abruptly put his washcloth to use. For quite a little
interval, the faint swush of it was the only sound in the bathroom. Mrs. Glass, seated
eight or ten feet away from the shower curtain, stared across the tiled floor at the blue
bathmat alongside the tub. Her cigarette had burned down to the last half inch. She held it
between the ends of two fingers of her right hand. Distinctly, her way of holding it tended
to blow to some sort of literary hell one's first, strong (and still perfectly tenable)
impression that an invisible Dubliner's shawl covered her shoulders. Not only were her
fingers of an extraordinary length and shapeliness—such as, very generally speaking, one
wouldn't have expected of a medium-stout woman's fingers—but they featured, as it
were, a somewhat imperial-looking tremor; a deposed Balkan queen or a retired favorite
courtesan might have had such an elegant tremor. And this was not the only contradiction
to the Dublin-black-shawl motif. There was the rather eyebrow-raising fact of Bessie
Glass's legs, which were comely by any criterion. They were the legs of a once quite
widely acknowledged public beauty, a vaude-villian, a dancer, a very light dancer. They
were crossed now, as she sat staring at the bathmat, left over right, a worn white
terrycloth slipper looking as if it might fall off the extended foot at any second. The feet
were extraordinarily small, the ankles were still slender, and, perhaps most remarkable,
the calves were still firm and evidently never had been knotty.
     A much deeper sigh than customary—almost, it seemed, a part of the life force
itself—suddenly came from Mrs. Glass. She got up and carried her cigarette over to the
washbowl, let cold water run on it, then dropped the extinguished stub into the
wastebasket and sat down again. The spell of introspection she had cast on herself was
unbroken, as if she hadn't moved from her seat at all.
     "I'm getting out of here in about three seconds, Bessie 1 I'm giving you fair warning.
Let's not wear out our welcome, buddy."
     Mrs. Glass, who had resumed staring at the blue bathmat, gave an absent-minded
nod at this "fair warning." And at that instant, more than just mentionably, had Zooey
seen her face, and particularly her eyes, he might have had a strong impulse, passing or
not, to recall, or reconstruct, or reinflect the greater part of his share of the conversation
that had passed between them—to temper it, to soften it. On the other hand, he might not
have. It was a very touch-and-go business, in 1955, to get a wholly plausible reading
from Mrs. Glass's face, and especially from her enormous blue eyes. Where once, a few
years earlier, her eyes alone could break the news (either to people or to bathmats) that
two of her sons were dead, one by suicide (her favorite, her most intricately calibrated,


her kindest son), and one killed in World War II (her only truly lighthearted son)—where
once Bessie Glass's eyes alone could report these facts, with an eloquence and a seeming
passion for detail that neither her husband nor any of her adult surviving children could
bear to look at, let alone take in, now, in 1955, she was apt to use this same terrible Celtic
equipment to break the news, usually at the front door, that the new delivery boy hadn't
brought the leg of lamb in time for dinner or that some remote Hollywood starlet's
marriage was on the rocks.
     She lit a fresh king-size cigarette abruptly, dragged on it, then stood up, exhaling
smoke. "I'll be back in a minute," she said. The statement sounded, innocently, like a
promise. "Just please use the bathmat when you get out," she added. "That's what it's
there for." She left the bathroom, closing the door securely behind her.
     It was rather as though, after being in makeshift wet dock for days, the Queen Mary
had just sailed out of, say, Walden Pond, as suddenly and perversely as she had sailed in.
Behind the shower curtain, Zooey closed his eyes for a few seconds, as though his own
small craft were listing precariously in the wake. Then he pulled back the shower curtain
and stared over at the closed door. It was a weighty stare, and relief was not really a great
part of it. As much as anything else, it was the stare, not so paradoxically, of a privacy-
lover who, once his privacy has been invaded, doesn't quite approve when the invader
just gets up and leaves, one-two-three, like that.



NOT five minutes later, Zooey, with his hair combed wet, stood barefoot at the
washbowl, wearing a pair of beltless dark-gray sharkskin slacks, a face towel across his
bare shoulders. A pre-shaving ritual had already been put into effect. The window blind
had been raised halfway; the bathroom door had been set ajar to let the steam escape and
clear the mirrors; a cigarette had been lit, dragged on, and placed within easy reach on the
frosted-glass ledge under the medicine-cabinet mirror. At the moment, Zooey had just
finished squeezing lather cream onto the end of a shaving brush. He put the tube of lather,
without re-capping it, somewhere into the enamel background, out of his way. He passed
the flat of his hand squeakily back and forth over the face of the medicine-cabinet mirror,
wiping away most of the mist. Then he began to lather his face. His lathering technique
was very much out of the ordinary, although identical in spirit with his actual shaving
technique. That is, although he looked into the mirror while he lathered, he didn't watch
where his brush was moving but, instead, looked directly into his own eyes, as though his
eyes were neutral territory, a no man's land in a private war against narcissism he had
been fighting since he was seven or eight years old. By now, when he was twenty-five,
the little stratagem may well have been mostly reflexive, just as a veteran baseball player,
at the plate, will tap his spikes with his bat whether he needs to or not. Nonetheless, a few
minutes earlier, when he had combed his hair, he had done so with the very minimum
amount of help from the mirror. And before that he had managed to dry himself in front
of a full-length mirror without so much as glancing into it.
    He had just finished lathering his face when his mother suddenly appeared in his
shaving mirror. She stood in the doorway, a few feet behind him, one hand on the
doorknob—a portrait of spurious hesitancy about making another full entrance into the


     "Ah! What a pleasant and gracious surprise!" Zooey said into the mirror. "Come in,
come in!" He laughed, or gave his roar, then opened the medicine cabinet and took down
his razor.
     Mrs. Glass advanced, meditatively. "Zooey..." she said. "I've been thinking." Her
usual seating accommodation was directly at Zooey's left. She started to lower herself
into place.
    "Don't sit down! Let me drink you in first,"
    Zooey said. Getting out of the tub, putting on his trousers, and combing his hair had
apparently raised his spirits. "It isn't often we have visitors at our little chapel, and when
we do, we try to make them feel—"
    "Just be still a minute," Mrs. Glass said firmly, sitting. She crossed her legs. "I've
been thinking. Do you think it would do any good to try to get hold of Waker? I don't,
personally, but what do you think? I mean in my opinion what that child needs is a good
psychiatrist, not a priest or anything, but I may be wrong."
     "Oh, no. No, no. Not wrong. I've never known you to be wrong, Bessie. Your facts
are always either untrue or exaggerated, but you're never wrong—no, no." With much
delight, Zooey wet his razor and began to shave.
     "Zooey, I'm asking you—just cut out the funny business, now, please. Do you or
don't you think I should get in touch with Waker? I could call that Bishop Pinchot or
whatever his name is, and he could probably tell me where I could at least wire him, if
he's still on some crazy boat." Mrs. Glass reached out and drew the metal wastebasket in
close to her and used it as an ashtray for the lighted cigarette she had brought in with her.
"I asked Franny if she'd like to talk to him on the phone," she said. "If I could get hold of
him."
    Zooey rinsed his razor briefly. "What'd she say?" he asked.
    Mrs. Glass adjusted her sitting position with a little evasive shift to the right. "She
says she doesn't want to talk to anybody."
     "Ah. We know better than that, don't we? We're not going to take a straight answer
like that lying down, are we?"
     "For your information, young man, I'm not going to take any answer of any kind
from that child today," Mrs. Glass said, rallying. She addressed Zooey's lathered profile.
"If you have a young girl lying in a room crying and mumbling to herself for forty-eight
hours, you don't go to them for any answers."
    Zooey, without commenting, went on shaving.
    "Answer my question, please. Do you or don't you think I should try to get in touch
with Waker? I'm afraid to, frankly. He's so emotional —priest or no priest. If you tell
Waker it looks like rain, his eyes all fill up."
    Zooey shared his amusement at this remark with the reflection of his own eyes in the
mirror. "There's hope for you yet, Bessie," he said.


   "Well, if I can't get Buddy on the phone, and even you won't help, I'm going to have
to do something," Mrs. Glass said. Looking vastly troubled, she sat smoking for a long
moment. Then: "If it was something strictly Catholic, or like that, I might be able to help
her myself. I haven't forgotten everything. But none of you children were brought up as
Catholics, and I really don't see—"
    Zooey cut her short. "You're off," he said, turning his lathered face toward her.
"You're off. You're way off. I told you that last night. This thing with Franny is strictly
non-sectarian." He dipped his razor and continued to shave. "Just take my word, please."
     Mrs. Glass stared full and pressingly at his profile, as if he might say something
further, but he didn't. At length, she sighed, and said, "I'd almost be satisfied for a while if
I could get that awful Bloomberg off that couch with her. It isn't even sanitary." She
dragged on her cigarette. "And I don't know what I'm supposed to do about the painters.
This very minute they're practically finished in her room, and they're going to be
champing at the bit to get in the living room."
     "You know, I'm the only one in this family who has no problems," Zooey said. "And
you know why? Because any time I'm feeling blue, or puzzled, what I do, I just invite a
few people to come visit me in the bathroom, and—well, we iron things out together,
that's all."
      Mrs. Glass seemed on the point of being diverted by Zooey's method of dealing with
problems, but it was her day to suppress all forms of amusement. She stared at him for a
moment, and then, slowly, a new look gathered in her eyes—resourceful, crafty, and a
trifle desperate. "You know, I'm not as stupid as you may think, young man," she said.
"You're all so secretive, all you children. It just so happens, if you must know, that I
know more about what's behind all this than you think I do." For emphasis, lips
compressed, she brushed some imaginary tobacco flakes from the lap of her kimono. "For
your information, I happen to know that that little book she carried all around the whole
house with her yesterday is at the whole root of this whole business."
     Zooey turned and glanced at her. He was grinning, "How'd you figure that out?" he
said.
     "Just never mind how I figured it out," Mrs. Glass said. "If you must know, Lane has
called up here several times. He's terribly worried about Franny."
    Zooey rinsed his razor. "Who in hell is Lane?" he asked. Unmistakably, it was the
question of a still very young man who, now and then, is not inclined to admit that he
knows the first names of certain people.
    "You know very well who he is, young man," Mrs. Glass said with emphasis. "Lane
Coutell. He's only been Franny's boy friend for a whole year. You've met him at least half
a dozen times that / know of, so just don't pretend you don't know who he is."
    Zooey gave a genuine roar of laughter, as if he clearly relished seeing any affectation
brought to light, his own included. He went on shaving, still delighted. "The expression is
Franny's 'young man,'" he said, "not her 'boy friend." Why are you so out of date, Bessie?
Why is that? Hm?"
    "Never mind why I'm so out of date. It may interest you to know that he's called up


here five or six times since Franny got home—twice this morning before you were even
up. He's been very sweet, and he's terribly concerned and worried about Franny."
    "Not like some people we know, eh? Well, I hate to disillusion you, but I've sat by
the hour with him and he's not sweet at all. He's a charm boy and a fake. Incidentally,
somebody around here's been shaving their armpits or their goddam legs with my razor.
Or dropped it. The head's way out of—"
    "Nobody's touched your razor, young man. Why is he a charm boy and a fake, may I
ask?"
     "Why? Because he is, that's all. Probably because it's paid off. I can tell you one
thing. If he's worried about Franny at all, I'll lay odds it's for the crummiest reasons. He's
probably worried because he minded leaving the goddam football game before it was
over—worried because he probably showed he minded it and he knows Franny's sharp
enough to have noticed. I can just picture the little bastard getting her into a cab and
putting her on a train and wondering if he can make it back to the game before the half
ended."
     "Oh, it's impossible to talk to you! But absolutely impossible. I don't know why I try,
even. You're just like Buddy. You think everybody does something for some peculiar
reason. You don't think anybody calls anybody else up without having some nasty,
selfish reason for it."
     "Exactly—in nine cases out of ten. And this Lane pill isn't the exception, you can be
sure. Listen, I talked with him for twenty deadly goddam minutes one night while Franny
was getting ready to go out, and I say he's a big nothing." He reflected, arresting his razor
stroke. "What in hell was it he was telling me? Something very winning. What was it? ...
Oh, yes. Yes. He was telling me he used to listen to Franny and me every week when he
was a kid —and you know what he was doing, the little bastard? He was building me up
at Franny's expense. For absolutely no reason except to ingratiate himself and show off
his hot little Ivy League intellect." Zooey put out his tongue and gave a subdued,
modified Bronx cheer. "Phooey," he said, and resumed using his razor. "Phooey, I say, on
all white-shoe college boys who edit their campus literary magazines. Give me an honest
con man any day."
      Mrs. Glass directed a long and oddly comprehensive look at his profile. "He's a
young boy not out of college yet. And you make people nervous, young man," she said—
most equably, for her. "You either take to somebody or you don't. If you do, then you do
all the talking and nobody can even get a word in edgewise. If you don't like somebody—
which is most of the time —then you just sit around like death itself and let the person
talk themself into a hole. I've seen you do it."
    Zooey turned full around to look at his mother.
     He turned around and looked at her, in this instance, in precisely the same way that,
at one time or another, in one year or another, all his brothers and sisters (and especially
his brothers) had turned around and looked at her. Not just with objective wonder at the
rising of a truth, fragmentary or not, up through what often seemed to be an impenetrable
mass of prejudices, cliches, and bromides. But with admiration, affection, and, not least,
gratitude. And, oddly or no, Mrs. Glass invariably took this "tribute," when it came, in


beautiful stride. She would look back with grace and modesty at the son or daughter who
had given her the look. She now presented this gracious and modest countenance to
Zooey. "You do," she said, without accusation in her voice. "Neither you nor Buddy
know how to talk to people you don't like." She thought it over. "Don't love, really," she
amended. And Zooey continued to stand gazing at her, not shaving. "It's not right," she
said— gravely, sadly. "You're getting so much like Buddy used to be when he was your
age. Even your father's noticed it. If you don't like somebody in two minutes, you're done
with them forever." Mrs. Glass looked over, abstractedly, at the blue bathmat, across the
tiled floor. Zooey stood as still as possible, in order not to break her mood. "You can't
live in the world with such strong likes and dislikes," Mrs. Glass said to the bathmat, then
turned again toward Zooey and gave him a long look, with very little, if any, morality in
it. "Regardless of what you may think, young man," she said.
     Zooey looked back at her steadily, then smiled and faced around to examine his
beard in the mirror. Mrs. Glass, watching him, sighed. She bent and put out her cigarette
against the inside of the metal wastebasket. She lit a fresh cigarette almost at once, and
said, as pointedly as she was able, "Anyway, your sister says he's a brilliant boy. Lane."
     "That's just sex talking, buddy," Zooey said. "I know that voice. Oh, do I know that
voice!" The last trace of lather had been shaved away from his face and throat. He felt his
throat critically with one hand, then picked up his shaving brush and began to re-lather
strategic parts of his face. "All right, what does Lane have to say on the phone?" he
asked. "According to Lane, what's behind Franny's troubles?"
    Mrs. Glass sat slightly and avidly forward, and said, "Well, Lane says it all has to
do—this entire thing—with that little book she's got with her all the time. You know.
That little book she kept reading all yesterday and dragging with her everywhere she—"
    "I know that little book. Go on."
    "Well, he says, Lane says, it's a terribly religious little book—fanatical and all like
that— and that she got it out of the library at college and now she thinks maybe she's—"
Mrs. Glass broke off. Zooey had turned toward her with somewhat menacing alertness.
"What's the matter?" she asked.
    "He said she got it where?"
    "Out of the library. At college. Why?"
    Zooey shook his head, and turned back to the washbowl. He put down his shaving
brush and opened the medicine cabinet.
     "What's the matter?" Mrs. Glass demanded. "What's the matter with that? Why such
a look, young man?"
    Zooey didn't reply till he had opened a new package of razor blades. Then,
dismantling his razor, he said, "You're so stupid, Bessie." He ejected the blade from his
razor.
    "Why am I so stupid? Incidentally, you just put a new razor blade in yesterday."
    Zooey, his face expressionless, locked a new blade into his razor and began his
second-time-over shave.


 "I asked you a question, young man. Why am I so stupid? Didn't she get that little
book out of her college library, or what?"
    "No, she didn't, Bessie," Zooey said, shaving. "That little book is called 'The Pilgrim
Continues His Way,' and it's a sequel to another little book, called 'The Way of a Pilgrim,'
which she's also dragging around with her, and she got both books out of Seymour and
Buddy's old room, where they've been sitting on Seymour's desk for as long as I can
remember. Jesus God almighty."
     "Well, don't get abusive about it! Is it so terrible to think she might have gotten them
out of her college library and simply brought them—"
    "Yes! It is terrible. It is terrible when both books have been sitting on Seymour's
goddam desk for years. It's depressing."
    An unexpected, a singularly noncombatant, note came into Mrs. Glass's voice. "I
don't go in that room if I can help it, and you know it," she said. "1 don't look at
Seymour's old—at his things."
     Zooey said, quickly, "All right, I'm sorry." Without looking at her, and although he
hadn't quite finished his second-time-over shave, he pulled the face towel down from his
shoulders and wiped the remaining lather off his face. "Let's just drop this for a while," he
said, and tossed the face towel over onto the radiator; it landed on the title page of the
Rick-Tina manuscript. He unscrewed his razor and held it under the cold-water tap.
     His apology had been genuine, and Mrs. Glass knew it, but evidently she couldn't
resist taking advantage of it, perhaps because of its rarity. "You're not kind," she said,
watching him rinse his razor. "You're not kind at all, Zooey. You're old enough to at least
try for some kind of kindness when you're feeling mean. Buddy, at least, when he's
feeling—" She simultaneously took in her breath and gave a great start as Zooey's razor,
new blade and all, slam-banged down into the metal wastebasket.
     Quite probably Zooey hadn't intended to send his razor crashing into the wastebasket
but had merely brought his left hand down with such suddenness and violence that the
razor got away from him. In any case, it was certain that he hadn't intended to strike and
hurt his wrist on the side of the washbowl. "Buddy, Buddy, Buddy," he said. "Seymour,
Seymour, Seymour." He had turned toward his mother, whom the crash of the razor had
startled and alarmed but not really frightened. "I'm so sick of their names I could cut my
throat." His face was pale but very nearly expressionless. "This whole goddam house
stinks of ghosts. I don't mind so much being haunted by a dead ghost, but I resent like
hell being haunted by a half-dead one. I wish to God Buddy'd make up his mind. He does
everything else Seymour ever did—or tries to. Why the hell doesn't he kill himself and be
done with it?"
     Mrs. Glass blinked her eyes, just once, and Zooey instantly looked away from her
face. He bent over and fished his razor out of the waste-basket. "We're freaks, the two of
us, Franny and I," he announced, standing up. "I'm a twenty-five-year-old freak and she's
a twenty-year-old freak, and both those bastards are responsible." He put his razor on the
edge of the washbowl, but it slid obstreperously down into the bowl. He quickly picked it
out, and this time kept it in the grasp of his fingers. "The symptoms are a little more
delayed in Franny's case than mine, but she's a freak, too, and don't you forget it. I swear

to you, I could murder them both without even batting an eyelash. The great teachers.
The great emancipators. My God. I can't even sit down to lunch with a man any more and
hold up my end of a decent conversation. I either get so bored or so goddam preachy that
if the son of a bitch had any sense, he'd break his chair over my head." He suddenly
opened the medicine cabinet. He stared rather vacuously into it for a few seconds, as
though he had forgotten why he opened it, then put his undried razor in its place on one
of the shelves.
     Mrs. Glass sat very still, watching him, her cigarette burning low between her
fingers. She watched him put the cap on the tube of shaving lather. He had some
difficulty finding the thread.
    "Not that anybody's interested, but I can't even sit down to a goddam meal, to this
day, without first saying the Four Great Vows under my breath, and I'll lay any odds you
want Franny can't, either. They drilled us with such goddam—"
    "The four great what?" Mrs. Glass interrupted, but cautiously.
     Zooey put a hand on each side of the washbowl and leaned his chest forward a trifle,
his eyes on the general background of enamel. For all his slightness of body, he looked at
that moment ready and able to push the washbowl straight through the floor. "The Four
Great Vows," he said, and, with rancor, closed his eyes. "'However innumerable beings
are, I vow to
     save them; however inexhaustible the passions are, I vow to extinguish them;
however immeasurable the Dharmas are, I vow to master them; however incomparable
the Buddha-truth is, I vow to attain it.' Yay, team. I know I can do it. Just put me in,
coach." His eyes stayed closed. "My God, I've been mumbling that under my breath three
meals a day every day of my life since I was ten. I can't eat unless I say it. I tried skipping
it once when I was having a lunch with LeSage. I gagged on a goddam cherrystone clam,
doing it." He opened his eyes, frowned, but kept his peculiar stance. "How 'bout getting
out of here, now, Bessie?" he said. "I mean it. Lemme finish my goddam ablutions in
peace, please." His eyes closed again, and he appeared ready to have another try at
pushing the washbowl through the floor. Even though his head was slightly down, a
considerable amount of blood had flowed out of his face.
    "I wish you'd get married," Mrs. Glass said, abruptly, wistfully.
    Everyone in the Glass family—Zooey certainly not least—was familiar with this sort
of non-sequitur from Mrs. Glass. It bloomed best, most sublimely, in the middle of an
emotional flareup of just this kind. This time, it caught Zooey very much off guard,
however. He gave an explosive sound, mostly through the nose, of either laughter or the
opposite of laughter. Mrs. Glass quickly and anxiously leaned forward to see which it
was. It was laughter, more or less, and she sat back, relieved. "Well, I do," she insisted.
"Why don't you?"
    Relaxing his stance, Zooey took a folded linen handkerchief from his hip pocket,
nipped it open, then used it to blow his nose once, twice, three times. He put away the
handkerchief, saying, "I like to ride in trains too much. You never get to sit next to the
window any more when you're married."
    "That's no reason!"


 "It's a perfect reason. Go away, Bessie. Leave me in peace in here. Why don't you go
for a nice elevator ride? You're going to burn your fingers, incidentally, if you don't put
out that goddam cigarette."
     Mrs. Glass put out her cigarette against the inside of the wastebasket again. She then
sat quietly for a little interval, without reaching for her cigarette pack and matches. She
watched Zooey take down a comb and re-part his hair. "You could use a haircut, young
man," she said. "You're getting to look like one of these crazy Hungarians or something
getting out of a swimming pool."
     Zooey perceptibly smiled, went on for a few seconds with his combing, then
suddenly turned. He wagged his comb briefly at his mother. "One other thing. Before I
forget. And listen to me, now, Bessie," he said. "If you get any more ideas, like last night,
of phoning Philly Byrnes' goddam psychoanalyst for Franny, just do one thing—that's all
I ask. Just think of what analysis did for Seymour." He paused for emphasis. "Hear me?
Will you do that?"
      Mrs. Glass immediately gave her hairnet an unnecessary adjustment, then took out
her cigarettes and matches, but she merely kept them for a moment in her hand. "For your
information," she said, "I didn't say I was going to phone Philly Byrnes' psychoanalyst, I
said I was thinking about it. In the first place, he isn't just an ordinary psychoanalyst. He
happens to be a very devout Catholic psychoanalyst, and I thought it might be better than
sitting around and watching that child—"
   "Bessie, I'm warning you, now, God damn it. I don't care if he's a very devout
Buddhist veterinarian. If you call in some—"
     "There's no need for sarcasm, young man. I've known Philly Byrnes since he was a
tiny little boy. Your father and I played on the same bill with his parents for years. And I
happen to know for a fact that going to a psychoanalyst has made an absolutely new and
lovely person out of that boy. I was talking to his—"
     Zooey slammed his comb into the medicine cabinet, then impatiently flipped the
cabinet door shut. "Oh, you're so stupid, Bessie," he said. "Philly Byrnes. Philly Byrnes is
a poor little impotent sweaty guy past forty who's been sleeping for years with a rosary
and a copy of Variety under his pillow. We're talking about two things as different as day
and night. Now, listen to me, Bessie." Zooey turned full toward his mother and looked at
her carefully, the flat of one hand on the enamel, as if for support. "You listening to me?"
    Mrs. Glass finished lighting a fresh cigarette before she committed herself. Then,
exhaling smoke and brushing off imaginary tobacco flakes from her lap, she said grimly,
"I'm listening to you."
     ."All right. I'm very serious, now. If you— Listen to me, now. If you can't, or won't,
think of Seymour, then you go right ahead and call in some ignorant psychoanalyst. You
just do that. You just call in some analyst who's experienced in adjusting people to the
joys of television, and Life magazine every Wednesday, and European travel, and the H-
Bomb, and Presidential elections, and the front page of the Times, and the responsibilities
of the Westport and Oyster Bay Parent-Teacher Association, and God knows what else
that's gloriously normal—you just do that, and I swear to you, in not more than a year
Franny'll either be in a nut ward or she'll be wandering off into some goddam desert with
a burning cross in her hands."
    Mrs. Glass brushed off a few more imaginary tobacco flakes. "All right, all right—
don't get so upset," she said. "For goodness' sake. Nobody's called anybody."
     Zooey yanked open the door of the medicine cabinet, stared inside, then took down a
nail file and closed the door. He picked up the cigarette he had posted on the edge of the
frosted-glass ledge and dragged on it, but it was dead. His mother said, "Here," and
handed him her pack of king-size cigarettes and her match folder. Zooey took a cigarette
out of the pack and got as far as putting it between his lips and striking a match, but the
pressure of thoughts made the actual lighting of the cigarette unfeasible, and he blew out
the match and took the cigarette down from his mouth. He gave a little, impatient
headshake. "I don't know," he said. "It seems to me there must be a psychoanalyst holed
up somewhere in town who'd be good for Fran-ny—I thought about that last night." He
grimaced slightly. "But I don't happen to know of any. For a psychoanalyst to be any
good with Franny at all, he'd have to be a pretty peculiar type. I don't know. He'd have to
believe that it was through the grace of God that he'd been inspired to study
psychoanalysis in the first place. He'd have to believe that it was through the grace of
God that he wasn't run over by a goddam truck before he ever even got his license to
practice. He'd have to believe that it's through the grace of God that he has the native
intelligence to be able to help his goddam patients at all. I don't know any good analysts
who think along those lines. But that's the only kin.d of psychoanalyst who might be able
to do Franny any good at all. If she got somebody terribly Freudian, or terribly eclectic,
or just terribly run-of-the-mill—somebody who didn't even have any crazy, mysterious
gratitude for his insight and intelligence—she'd come out of analysis in even worse shape
than Seymour did. It worried hell out of me, thinking about it. Let's just shut up about it,
if you don't mind." He took time to get his cigarette lighted. Then, exhaling smoke, he put
the cigarette up on the frosted-glass ledge where the old, dead cigarette was, and assumed
a slightly more relaxed stance. He began to run the nail file under his fingernails —which
were already perfectly clean. "If you don't yak at me," he said, after a pause, "I'll tell you
what those two little books are about that Franny's got with her. Are you interested, or
not? If you're not interested, I don't feel like—"
    "Yes, I'm interested! Of course I'm interested! What do you think I'm—"
      "All right, just don't yak at me for a minute, then," Zooey said, and rested the small
of his back against the edge of the washbowl. He went on using the nail file. "Both books
are about a Russian peasant, around the turn of the century," he said, in what was, for his
implacably matter-of-fact voice, a rather narrative tone. "He's a very simple, very sweet
little guy with a withered arm. Which, of course, makes him a natural for Franny, with
that goddam Bide-a-Wee Home heart of hers." He pivoted around, picked up his cigarette
from the frosted-glass ledge, dragged on it, then began to file his nails. "In the beginning,
the little peasant tells you, he had a wife and a farm. But he had a looney brother who
burned down the farm—and then, later, I think, the wife just died. Anyway, he Starts on
his pilgrimage. And he has a problem. He's been reading the Bible all his life, and he
wants to know what it means when it says, in Thessalonians, Pray without ceasing.' That
one line keeps haunting him." Zooey reached for his cigarette again, dragged on it, and
then said, "There's another, similar line in Timothy—'I will therefore that men pray
everywhere.' And Christ himself, as a matter of fact, says, 'Men ought always to pray and
not to faint.'" Zooey used his nail file in silence for a moment, his face singularly dour in
expression. "So, anyway, he begins his pilgrimage to find a teacher," he said. "Someone
who can teach him how to pray incessantly, and why. He walks and he walks and he
walks, from one church and shrine to another, talking to this priest and that. Till finally
he meets a simple old monk who apparently knows what it's all about. The old monk tells
him that the one prayer acceptable to God at all times, and 'desired' by God, is the Jesus
Prayer —'Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.' Actually, the whole prayer is 'Lord Jesus
Christ, have mercy on me, a miserable sinner,' but none of the adepts in either of the
Pilgrim books put any emphasis—thank God—on the miserable-sinner part. Anyway, the
old monk explains to him what will happen if the prayer is said incessantly. He gives him
some practice sessions with it and sends him home. And—to make a long story short—
after a while the little pilgrim becomes proficient with the prayer. He masters it. He's
overjoyed with his new spiritual life, and he goes on hiking all over Russia—through
dense forests, through towns, villages, and so on —saying his prayer as he goes along and
telling everyone he happens to meet how to say it, too." Zooey looked up, brusquely, at
his mother. "You listening to this? You fat old Druid?" he inquired. "Or are you just
staring at my gorgeous face?"
    Mrs. Glass, bristling, said, "Certainly I'm listening!"
      "All right—I don't want any party poops around here." Zooey gave a great guffaw,
then took a drag on his cigarette. He kept the cigarette stationed between his fingers and
went on using the nail file. "The first of the two little books, 'The Way of a Pilgrim,'" he
said, "has mostly to do with the adventures the little pilgrim has on the road. Whom he
meets, what he says to them, what they say to him—he meets some goddam nice people,
incidentally. The sequel, 'The Pilgrim Continues His Way,' is mostly a dissertation in
dialogue form on the whys and wherefores of the Jesus Prayer. The pilgrim, a professor, a
monk, and some sort of hermit all meet and hash over things. And that's all there is to it,
really." Zooey glanced up, very briefly, at his mother, then switched the nail file over to
his left hand. "The aim of both little books, if you're interested," he said, "is supposedly
to wake everybody up to the need and benefits of saying the Jesus Prayer incessantly.
First under the supervision of a qualified teacher—-a sort of Christian guru—and then,
after the person's mastered it to some extent, he's supposed to go on with it on his own.
And the main idea is that it's not supposed to be just for pious bastards and breast-beaters.
You can be busy robbing the goddam poor box, but you're to say the prayer while you
rob it. Enlightenment's supposed to come with the prayer, not before it." Zooey frowned,
but academically. "The idea, really, is that sooner or later, completely on its own, the
prayer moves from the lips and the head down to a center in the heart and becomes an
automatic function in the person, right along with the heartbeat. And then, after a time,
once the prayer is automatic in the heart, the person is supposed to enter into the so-called
reality of things. The subject doesn't really come up in either of the books, but, in Eastern
terms, there are seven subtle centers in the body, called cha-kras, and the one most
closely connected with the heart is called anahata, which is supposed to be sensitive and
powerful as hell, and when it's activated, it, in turn, activates another of these centers,
between the eyebrows, called ajna—it's the pineal gland, really, or, rather, an aura around
the pineal gland — and then, bingo, there's an opening of what mystics call the 'third eye.'
It's nothing new, for God's sake. It didn't just start with the little pilgrim's crowd, I mean.
In India, for God knows how many centuries, it's been known as japam. Japam is just the


repetition of any of the human names of God. Or the names of his incarnations—his
avatars, if you want to get technical. The idea being that if you call out the name long
enough and regularly enough and literally from the heart, sooner or later you'll get an
answer. Not exactly an answer. A response." Zooey suddenly turned around, opened the
medicine cabinet, replaced his nail file, and took down a remarkably stubby-looking
orange stick. "Who's been eating my orange stick?" he said. With his wrist, he briefly
blotted his perspiring upper lip, and then he began to use the orange stick to push back his
cuticles.
     Mrs. Glass took a deep drag on her cigarette, watching him, then crossed her legs
and asked, demanded, "Is that what Franny's supposed to be doing? I mean is that what
she's doing and all?"
    "So I gather. Don't ask me, ask her."
    There was a short pause, and a dubious one. Then Mrs. Glass abruptly and rather
pluckily asked, "How long do you have to do it?"
     Zooey's face lit up with pleasure. He turned to her. "How long?" he said. "Oh, not
long. Till the painters want to get in your room. Then a procession of saints and
bodhisattvas march in, carrying bowls of chicken broth. The Hall Johnson Choir starts up
in the background, and the cameras move in on a nice old gentleman in a loincloth
standing against a background of mountains and blue skies and white clouds, and a look
of peace comes over everybody's—"
    "All right, just stop that," Mrs. Glass said.
      "Well, Jesus. I'm only trying to help. Mercy. I don't want you to go away with the
impression that there're any—you know—any incon-veniences involved in the religious
life. I mean a lot of people don't take it up just because they think it's going to involve a
certain amount of nasty application and perseverance—you know what I mean." It was
clear that the speaker, with patent relish, was now reaching the high point of his address.
He wagged his orange stick solemnly at his mother. "As soon as we get out of the chapel
here, I hope you'll accept from me a little volume I've always admired. I believe it
touches on some of the fine points we've discussed this morning. 'God Is My Hobby.' By
Dr. Homer Vincent Claude Pierson, Jr. In this little book, I think you'll find, Dr. Pierson
tells us very clearly how when he was twenty-one years of age he started putting aside a
little time each day—two minutes in the morning and two minutes at night, if I remember
correctly—and at the end of the first year, just by these little informal visits with God, he
increased his annual income seventy-four per cent. I believe I have an extra copy, and if
you'll be good enough—"
     "Oh, you're impossible," Mrs. Glass said. But vaguely. Her eyes had again sought
out her old friend the blue bathmat, across the room. She sat staring at it while Zooey—
grinning but perspiring freely at his upper lip—went on using his orange stick. At length,
Mrs. Glass heaved one of her premium sighs and returned her attention to Zooey, who,
pushing at his cuticles, had pivoted a half turn toward the morning daylight. As she took
in the lines and planes of his uncommonly spare unclothed back, her gaze gradually de-
abstracted. In a matter of only a few seconds, in fact, her eyes appeared to jettison
everything that was dark and heavy and to glow with fan-club appreciation. "You're

getting so broad and lovely," she said, aloud, and reached out to touch the small of his
back. "I was afraid all those crazy bar-bell exercises would do some—"
    "Don't, willya?" Zooey said, quite sharply, recoiling.
    "Don't what?"
     Zooey pulled open the medicine-cabinet door and put the orange stick back in its
niche. "Just don't, that's all. Don't admire my goddam back," he said, and closed the
cabinet. He picked off a pair of black silk socks that were hanging on the towel bar and
carried them over to the radiator. He sat down on the radiator, despite the heat— or
because of it—and began to put on his socks.
     Mrs. Glass gave a rather delayed snort. "Don't admire your back—I love that!" she
said. But she was insulted, and a trifle hurt. She watched him put on his socks, with a
mixed expression of injury and the ungovernable interest of someone who has been
examining laundered socks for holes for a great many years. Then, suddenly, with one of
her most audible sighs, she stood up and, grim and duty-bound, moved into the
washstand area Zooey had vacated. Her first, blatantly martyred chore was to turn on the
cold-water tap. "I wish you'd learn to put the caps back on things properly when you're
finished using them," she said in a tone she fully meant to sound captious.
      From the radiator, where he was attaching supporters to his socks, Zooey glanced up
at her. "I wish you'd learn to leave the goddam party when it's over," he said. "I mean it,
now, Bessie. I'd like about one minute of solitude in here— rude as it may sound. In the
first place, I'm in a hurry. I have to be at LeSage's office at two-thirty, and I'd like to get a
couple of things done downtown first. Let's go, now—do you mind?"
    Mrs. Glass turned from her char duties to look at him and to ask a question of the
kind that, over the years, had irritated every one of her children: "You're going to have
some lunch before you go, aren't you?"
    "I'll get a bite downtown. . . . Where the hell's my other shoe?"
     Mrs. Glass stared at him, deliberately. "Are you or aren't you going to speak to your
sister before you leave here?" she demanded.
     "I don't know, Bessie," Zooey answered, after a perceptible hesitation. "Just stop
asking me that, please. If I had something really hot to say to her this morning, I would.
Just stop asking me." One shoe on and tied, the other shoe missing, he suddenly got down
on his hands and knees and passed a hand back and forth under the radiator. "Ah. There
you are, you little bastard," he said. A small bathroom scale stood beside the radiator. He
sat down on it, missing shoe in hand.
     Mrs. Glass watched him pull it on. She didn't stay for the tying of the lace, however.
Instead, she left the room. But slowly. Moving with a certain uncharacteristic
heaviness—a drag, actually—that distracted Zooey. He looked up and over at her with
considerable attention. "I just don't know any more what's happened to all you children,"
Mrs. Glass said vaguely, without turning around. She stopped at one of the towel bars and
straightened a washcloth. "In the old radio days, when you were all little and all, you all
used to be so—smart and happy and—just lovely. Morning, noon, and night." She bent
over and picked up from the tiled floor what appeared to be a long, mysteriously blondish


human hair. She made a slight detour with it over to the wastebasket, saying, "I don't
know what good it is to know so much and be smart as whips and all if it doesn't make
you happy." Her back was toward Zooey as she moved again toward the door. "At least,"
she said, "you all used to be so sweet and loving to each other it was a joy to see." She
opened the door, shaking her head. "Just a joy," she said firmly, and closed the door
behind her.
     Zooey, looking over at the closed door, inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly. "Some
exit lines you give yourself, buddy!" he called after her—but only when he must have
been sure that his voice wouldn't really reach her down the hall.



THE Glasses' living room was about as unready to have its walls repainted as a room can
be. Franny Glass lay asleep on the couch, with an afghan over her; the "wall-to-wall"
carpet had been neither taken up nor folded in at the borders; and the furniture—
seemingly, a small warehouse of it—was in its usual static-dynamic distribution. The
room was not impressively large, even by Manhattan apartment-house standards, but
its accumulated furnishings might have lent a snug appearance to a banquet hall in
Valhalla. There was a Steinway grand piano (invariably kept open), three radios (a 1927
Freshman, a 1932 Stromberg-Carlson, and a 1941 R.C.A.), a twenty-one-inch-screen
television set, four table-model phonographs (including a 1920 Victrola, with its speaker
still mounted intact, topside), cigarette and magazine tables galore, a regulation-size ping-
pong table (mercifully collapsed and stored behind the piano), four comfortable chairs,
eight uncomfortable chairs, a twelve-gallon tropical-fish tank (filled to capacity, in every
sense of the word, and illuminated by two forty-watt bulbs), a love seat, the couch Franny
was occupying, two empty bird cages, a cherrywood writing table, and an assortment of
floor lamps, table lamps, and "bridge" lamps that sprang up all over the congested
inscape like sumac. A cordon of waist-high bookcases lined three walls, their shelves
cram-jammed and literally sagging with books—children's books, textbooks, second-
hand books, Book Club books, plus an even more heterogeneous overflow from less
communal "annexes" of the apartment. ("Dracula" now stood next to "Elementary Pali,"
"The Boy Allies at the Somme" stood next to "Bolts of Melody," "The Scarab Murder
Case" and "The Idiot" were together, "Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase" lay on top
of "Fear and Trembling.") Even if a resolute and unusually stout-hearted team of painters
had been able to deal with the bookcases, the walls themselves, directly behind them,
might well have made any self-respecting artisan turn in his union card. From the top of
the bookcases to within less than a foot of the ceiling, the plaster —a blistery Wedgwood
blue, where visible— was almost completely covered with what may very loosely be
called "hangings," meaning a collection of framed photographs, yellowing personal and
Presidential correspondence, bronze and silver plaques, and a sprawling miscellany of
vaguely citational-looking documents and trophy like objects of various shapes and sizes,
all attesting, one way or another, to the redoubtable fact that from 1927 through most of
1943 the network radio program called "It's a Wise Child" had very rarely gone on the air
without one (and, more often, two) of the seven Glass children among its panelists.
(Buddy Glass, who, at thirty-six, was the program's oldest living ex-panelist, not
infrequently referred to the walls of his parents' apartment as being a kind of visual hymn


to commercial American childhood and early puberty. He often expressed regret that his
visits in from the country were so few and far between, and pointed out, usually at
enormous length, how much luckier his brothers and sisters were, most of whom still
lived in or around New York City.) The decoration scheme for the walls was, in fact, the
brain child—with Mrs. Glass's unreserved spiritual sanction and everlastingly withheld
formal consent—of Mr. Les Glass, the children's father, a former international
vaudevillian and, no doubt, an inveterate and wistful admirer of the wall decor at Sardi's
theatrical restaurant. Mr. Glass's perhaps most inspired coup as a decorator was manifest
just behind and above the couch where young Franny Glass was now sleeping. There, in
almost incestuously close juxtaposition, seven scrap-books of newspaper and magazine
clippings had been bracketed, at the bindings, directly into the plaster. Year after year,
plainly, all seven scrapbooks stood ready to be perused or pored over by old close friends
of the family and casual visitors alike, as well as, presumably, the odd part-time cleaning
woman.
     Just mentionably, Mrs. Glass had managed earlier that morning to make two token
gestures on behalf of the arriving painters. The room could be entered through either the
hall or the dining room, and at each of these entrances there were glass-paned double
doors. Directly after breakfast, Mrs. Glass had stripped the doors of their pleated silk
curtains. And later, at an opportune moment, when Franny was pretending to sample a
cup of chicken broth, Mrs. Glass had climbed up on the window seats with the agility of a
mountain nanny goat and stripped all three of the sash windows of their heavy damask
curtains.
     The room had a single, a southern, exposure. A four-story private school for girls
stood directly across the side street—a stolid and rather aloofly anonymous-looking
building that rarely came alive till about three-thirty in the afternoon, when public-school
children from Third and Second Avenues came to play jacks or stoop-ball on its stone
steps. The Glasses had a fifth-story apartment, a story higher than the school building,
and at this hour the sun was shining over the school roof and through the Glasses' naked
living-room windows. Sunshine was very unkind to the room. Not only were the
furnishings old, intrinsically unlovely, and clotted with memory and sentiment, but the
room itself in past years had served as the arena for countless hockey and football (tackle
as well as "touch") games, and there was scarcely a leg on any piece of furniture that
wasn't badly nicked or marred. There were scars much nearer to eye level, too, from a
rather awesome variety of airborne objects—beanbags, baseballs, marbles, skate keys,
soap erasers, and even, on one well-marked occasion in the early nineteen-thirties, a
flying headless porcelain doll. Sunshine, however, was perhaps most particularly unkind
to the carpet. It had originally been a port-red color—and by lamplight, at least, still
was—but it now featured a number of rather pancreas-shaped faded spots, unsentimental
mementos, all, of a series of household pets. The sun at this hour shone as far, as deep, as
mercilessly into the room as the television set, striking it squarely in its unblinking
cyclopean eye.
     Mrs. Glass, who did some of her most inspired, most perpendicular thinking on the
threshold of linen closets, had bedded down her youngest child on the couch between
pink percale sheets, and covered her with a pale-blue cashmere afghan. Franny now lay
sleeping on her left side, facing into the back of the couch and the wall, her chin just

grazing one of the several toss pillows all around her. Her mouth was closed, but only
just. Her right hand, however, on the coverlet, was not merely closed but shut tight; the
fingers were clenched, the thumb tucked in—it was as though, at twenty, she had checked
back into the mute, fisty defenses of the nursery. And here at the couch, it should be
mentioned, the sun, for all its ungraciousness to the rest of the room, was behaving
beautifully. It shone full on Franny's hair, which was jet-black and very prettily cut, and
had been washed three times in as many days. Sunshine, in fact, bathed the entire afghan,
and the play of warm, brilliant light in the pale-blue wool was in itself well worth
beholding.
     Zooey, almost direct from the bathroom, with a lighted cigar in his mouth, stood for
quite a while at the foot of the couch, at first busy tucking in the ends of a white shirt he
had put on, then buttoning his cuffs, and then merely standing and looking. He wore a
frown behind his cigar, as though the stunning lighting effects had been "created" by a
stage director whose taste he considered more or less suspect. Despite the extraordinary
fineness of his features, and his age, and his general stature—clothed, he could easily
have passed for a young, underweight danseur —the cigar was not markedly unbecoming
to him. For one reason, he was not really short-nosed. For another, cigars, with Zooey,
were not in any patent way a young man's affectation. He had been smoking them since
he was sixteen, and regularly, as many as a dozen a day —expensive panatelas, for the
most part—since he was eighteen.
     A Vermont-marble coffee table, rectangular and quite long, stood parallel and very
close to the couch. Zooey abruptly went over to it. He moved an ashtray, a silver cigarette
box, and a copy of Harper's Bazaar out of the way, then directly sat down in the narrow
space on the cold marble surface, facing—almost hovering over— Franny's head and
shoulders. He looked briefly at the clenched hand on the blue afghan, then, quite gently,
with his cigar in his hand, took hold of Franny's shoulder. "Franny," he said. "Frances.
Let's go, buddy. Let's not fritter away the best part of the day here. . . . Let's go, buddy."
    Franny awakened with a start—a jolt, really, as though the couch had just gone over
a bad bump. She raised up on one arm, and said, "Whew." She squinted at the morning
sunlight. "Why's it so sunny?" She only partly took in Zooey's presence. "Why's it so
sunny?" she repeated.
    Zooey observed her rather narrowly. "I bring the sun wherever I go, buddy," he said.
      Franny, still squinting, stared at him. "Why'd you wake me up?" she asked. She was
still too heavy with sleep to sound really fractious, but it was apparent that she felt there
was some kind of injustice in the air.
    "Well . . . it's like this. Brother Anselmo and I have been offered a new parish. In
Labrador, see. And we wondered if you'd give us your blessing before we—"
     "Whew!" Franny said again, and put her hand on top of her head. Her hair, cut
fashionably short, had survived sleep very well indeed. She wore it—most fortunately for
the viewer— parted in the middle. "Oh, I had the most horrible dream," she said. She sat
up a bit and, with one hand, closed the lapels of her dressing gown. It was a tailored tie-
silk dressing gown, beige, with a pretty pattern of minute pink tea roses.
    "Go ahead," Zooey said, dragging on his cigar. "I'll interpret for you."

  She shuddered. "It was just horrible. So spidery. I've never had such a spidery
nightmare in my entire life."
    "Spiders, eh? That's very interesting. Very significant. I had a very interesting case in
Zurich, some years back—a young person very much like yourself, as a matter of fact—"
     "Be quiet a second, or I'll forget it," Franny said. She stared avidly into space, as
nightmare-recallers do. There were half circles under her eyes, and other, subtler signs
that mark an acutely troubled young girl, but nonetheless no one could have missed
seeing that she was a first-class beauty. Her skin was lovely, and her features were
delicate and most distinctive. Her eyes were very nearly the same quite astonishing shade
of blue as Zooey's, but were set farther apart, as a sister's eyes no doubt should be—and
they were not, so to speak, a day's work to look into, as Zooey's were. Some four years
earlier, at her graduation from boarding school, her brother Buddy had morbidly
prophesied to himself, as she grinned at him from the graduates' platform, that she would
in all probability one day marry a man with a hacking cough. So there was that in her
face, too. "Oh, God, I remember it now!" she said. "It was just hideous. I was at a
swimming pool somewhere, and a whole bunch of people kept making me dive for a can
of Medaglia d'Oro coffee that was on the bottom.
      Every time I'd come up, they'd make me go down again. I was crying, and I kept
saying to everybody, 'You have your bathing suits on. Why don't you do a little diving,
too?,' but they'd all just laugh and make these terribly snide little remarks, and down I'd
go again." She gave another shudder. "These two girls that are in my dorm were there.
Stephanie Logan, and a girl I hardly even know—somebody, as a matter of fact, I always
felt terribly sorry for, because she had such an awful name. Shannon Sherman. They both
had a big oar, and they kept trying to hit me with it every time I'd surface." Franny put
her hands over her eyes briefly. "Whew!" She shook her head. She reflected. "The only
person that made any sense in the dream was Professor Tupper. I mean he was the only
person that was there that I know really detests me."
    "Detests you, eh? Very interesting." Zooey's cigar was in his mouth. He revolved it
slowly between his fingers, like a dream-interpreter who isn't getting all the facts in the
case. He looked very contented. "Why does he detest you?" he asked. "Without absolute
frankness, you realize, my hands are—"
    "He detests me because I'm in this crazy Religion seminar he conducts, and I can
never bring myself to smile back at him when he's being charming and Oxfordish. He's
on lend-lease or something from Oxford, and he's just a terribly sad old self-satisfied
phony with wild and woolly white hair. I think he goes into the men's room and musses it
up before he conies to class—I honestly do. He has no enthusiasm whatever for his
subject. Ego, yes. Enthusiasm, no. Which would be all right—I mean it wouldn't be
anything exactly strange—but he keeps dropping idiotic hints that he's a Realized Man
himself and we should be pretty happy kids to have him in this country." Franny
grimaced. "The only thing he does with any zing, when he isn't bragging, is correct
somebody when they say something's Sanskrit when it's really Pali. He just knows I can't
stand him! You should see the faces I make at him when he isn't looking."
    "What was he doing at the pool?"


  "That's exactly it! Nothing! Absolutely nothing! He was just standing around smiling
and watching. He was the worst one there."
     Zooey, looking at her through his cigar smoke, said dispassionately, "You look like
hell. You know that?"
     Franny stared at him. "You could have sat there all morning without saying that," she
said. She added, with meaning, "Just don't start in on me again, bright and early in the
morning, Zooey, please. I mean it, now."
     "Nobody's starting in on you, buddy," Zooey said, in the same dispassionate tone.
"You just happen to look like hell, that's all. Why don't you eat something? Bessie says
she's got some chicken soup out there she's—"
    "If anybody else mentions chicken soup to me just once more—"
    Zooey's attention, however, had been diverted. He was looking down at the sun-
bathed afghan where it covered Franny's calves and ankles. "Who's that?" he said.
"Bloomberg?" He put out a finger and gently poked a rather large and oddly mobile-
looking bulge under the afghan. "Bloomberg? That you?"
     The bulge stirred. Franny had her eye on it now, too. "I can't get rid of him," she
said. "He's suddenly become absolutely mad about me."
    Under the stimulus of Zooey's investigating finger, Bloomberg abruptly stretched,
then began to tunnel slowly up toward the open country of Franny's lap. The instant his
unprepossessing head emerged into daylight, sunlight, Franny took him under the
shoulders and lifted him up into intimate greeting distance. "Good morning, Bloomberg
dear!" she said, and kissed him fervently between the eyes. He blinked with aversion.
"Good morning, old fat smelly cat. Good morning, good morning, good morning!" She
gave him kiss after kiss, but no reciprocal waves of affection rose from him. He made an
inept and rather violent attempt to cross over to Franny's collarbone. He was a very large
mottled-gray "altered" tomcat. "Isn't he being affectionate?" Franny marvelled. "I've
never seen him so affectionate." She looked at Zooey, possibly for corroboration, but
Zooey's expression, behind his cigar, was noncommittal. "Pet him, Zooey! Look how
sweet he looks. Pet him."
    Zooey put out a hand and stroked Bloomberg's arched back, once, twice, then quit,
and got up from the coffee table and meandered across the room to the piano. It stood, in
profile, wide open, in all its black, Steinway enormity, opposite the couch, its bench
almost directly across from Franny. Zooey sat down on the bench, tentatively, then
looked with very apparent interest at the sheet music on the stand.
    "He's so full of fleas it isn't even funny," Franny said. She grappled briefly with
Bloomberg, trying to coerce him into a docile lap-cat's repose. "I found fourteen fleas on
him last night. Just on one side." She gave Bloomberg's hips a mighty, downward push,
then looked over at Zooey. "How was the script, anyway?" she asked. "Did it come last
night finally, or what?"
    Zooey didn't answer her. "My God," he said, still looking at the sheet music on the
stand. "Who took this out?" The sheet music was entitled "You Needn't Be So Mean,
Baby." It was about forty years old. A sepia reproduction of Mr. and Mrs. Glass was

featured on the cover. Mr. Glass was wearing a top hat and tails, and so was Mrs. Glass.
They were smiling rather brilliantly at the camera, both of them leaning forward on their
evening canes, feet wide apart.
    "What is it?" Franny asked. "I can't see."
    "Bessie and Les. 'You Needn't Be So Mean, Baby.'"
    "Oh." Franny giggled. "Les was Reminiscing last night. For my benefit. He thinks I
have a stomachache. He took out every single sheet of music in the whole bench."
    "I'd be interested to know just how in hell we ever landed in this goddam jungle, all
the way from 'You Needn't Be So Mean, Baby.' You figure it out."
    "I can't. I've tried," Franny said. "How was the script? Did it come? You said
Whosis—Mr. LeSage or whatever his name is—was going to drop it off with the
doorman before he—"
     "It came, it came," Zooey said. "I don't care to discuss it." He put his cigar in his
mouth, and, with his right hand, up in the treble keys, he began to play, in octaves, the
melody of a song called "The Kinkajou," which, somewhat notably, had shifted into and
ostensibly out of popularity before he was born. "Not only it came," he said, "but Dick
Hess called up here about one o'clock last night—just after our little fracas—and asked
me to meet him for a drink, the bastard. At the San Remo, yet. He's discovering the
Village. God almighty!"
    "Don't bang the piano keys," Franny said, watching him. "I'll be your director if
you're going to sit there. That's my first direction. Don't bang the piano keys."
     "First of all, he knows I don't drink. Second, he knows I was born in New York and
that if there's one thing I can't stand it's atmosphere. Third, he knows I live about seventy
goddam
     blocks from the Village. And fourth, I told him three times I was in my pajamas and
slippers."
    "Don't bang the keys," Franny directed, petting Bloomberg.
   "But no, it couldn't wait. He had to see me right away. Very important. No kidding,
now. Be a good guy for once in your life and hop in a cab and c'mon down."
    "Did you? Don't bang the lid down, either. That's my second—"
      "Yes, certainly I didl I have no goddam will power!" Zooey said. He closed the
keyboard lid, impatiently but without banging it. "The trouble with me is, I don't trust any
out-of-towners in New York. I don't care how the hell long they've been here. I'm always
afraid they're going to get run over, or beaten up, while they're busy discovering some
little Armenian restaurant on Second Avenue. Or some damn thing." Morosely, he blew a
stream of cigar smoke over the top of "You Needn't Be So Mean, Baby." "So, anyway, I
went down there," he said. "And there was old Dick. So down, so blue, so full of
important news that couldn't wait till this afternoon. Sitting at a table in blue jeans and a
gruesome sports jacket. The Des Moines expatriate in New York. I could've killed him, I
swear to God. What a night. I sat there for two solid hours while he told me what a
superior son of a bitch I am, and what a family of psychotics and psychopathic prodigies


I come from. Then, when he's all through analyzing me—and Buddy, and Seymour, both
o£ whom he's never met —and when he's reached some sort of impasse in his mind
whether he's going to be a sort of two-fisted Colette or a sort of short Thomas Wolfe for
the rest of the evening, suddenly he pulls out this gorgeous monogrammed attache case
from under the table and shoves a new, hour-long script under my arm." He made a pass
at the air with one hand, as if to dismiss the subject. But he got up from the piano bench
too restively for it to have been a real gesture of dismissal. His cigar was in his mouth, his
hands were in his hip pockets. "For years I've been listening to Buddy sound off on the
subject of actors," he said. "My God, what an earful I could give him on the subject of
Writers I've Known." He stood abstracted for a moment, then became aimlessly mobile.
He stopped at the 1920 Victrola, looked at it blankly, and barked, twice, for his own
amusement, into its megaphone speaker. Franny, watching him, giggled, but he frowned,
and moved on. At the tropical-fish tank, which was mounted on top of the 1927
Freshman radio, he abruptly stooped, taking his cigar out of his mouth. He peered into the
tank with unmistakable interest. "All my black mollies are dying off," he said. He
reached, automatically, for the container of fish food beside the tank.
    "Bessie fed them this morning," Franny cautioned him. She was still stroking
Bloomberg, still succoring him, forcibly, into the subtle and difficult world outside warm
afghans.
    "They look starved," Zooey said, but withdrew his hand from the fish food. "This
guy has a very drawn look." He tapped the glass with his fingernail. "What you need is
some chicken soup, buddy."
    "Zooey," Franny said, to get his attention. "How does it stand now? You have two
new scripts. What's the one LeSage dropped by in the cab?"
     Zooey went on peering in at the fish for a moment. Then, on a sudden but apparently
pressing impulse, he stretched out supine on the carpet. "In the one LeSage sent over," he
said, crossing his feet, "I'm supposed to be Rick Chalmers in, I swear to God, a 1928
drawing-room comedy straight out of French's catalogue. The only difference is that it's
brought gloriously up to date with a lot of jargon about complexes and repressions and
sublimations that the writer brought home from his analyst's."
    Franny looked at what she could see of him. Only his soles and heels were visible
from where she sat. "Well, what about Dick's thing?" she asked. "Have you read it yet?"
    "In Dick's thing, I can be Bernie, a sensitive young subway guard, in the most
courageous goddam offbeat television opus you ever read."
    "You mean it? Is it really good?"
     "I didn't say good, I said courageous. Let's keep on our toes here, buddy. The
morning after it's produced, everybody in the building'll go around slamming each other
on the back in an orgy of mutual appreciation. LeSage. Hess. Pomeroy. The sponsors.
The whole courageous bunch. It'll all start this afternoon. If it hasn't already. Hess'll go
into LeSage's office and say to him, 'Mr. LeSage, sir, I've got a new script about a
sensitive young subway guard that just stinks of courage and integrity. And I know, sir,
that next to scripts that are Tender and Poignant, you love scripts that have Courage and
Integrity. This one, sir, as I say, stinks of both. It's full of melting-pot types. It's

sentimental. It's violent in the right places. And just when the sensitive subway guard's
problems are getting the best of him, destroying his faith in Mankind and the Little
People, his nine-year-old niece conies home from school and gives him some nice, pat
chauvinistic philosophy handed down to us through posterity and P.S. 564 all the way
from Andrew Jackson's backwoods wife. It can't miss, sir! It's down-to-earth, it's simple,
it's untrue, and it's familiar enough and trivial enough to be understood and loved by our
greedy, nervous, illiterate sponsors.'" Zooey abruptly raised himself up to a sitting
position. "I just took a bath, and I'm sweating like a pig," he commented. He got to his
feet, and, doing so, glanced briefly, and as if against his better judgment, at Franny. He
started to look away but, instead, looked at her more closely. She had her head down, and
her eyes on Bloomberg, in her lap, whom she had continued to stroke. But there was a
change. "Ah," Zooey said, and came closer to the couch, apparently looking for trouble.
"Madam's lips are moving. The Prayer is rising." Franny didn't look up. "What the hell
are you doing?" he asked. "Taking refuge from my un-Christian attitude to the popular
arts?"
    Franny looked up then, and shook her head, blinking. She smiled at him. Her lips
had, in fact, been moving, and were moving now.
    "Just don't smile at me, please," Zooey said, evenly, and walked out of the vicinity.
"Seymour was always doing that to me. This goddam house is lousy with smilers." At
one of the bookcases, he gave a misaligned book an orderly little push with his thumb,
then passed on. He went over to the middle window in the room, which was separated by
a window seat from the cherry-wood table where Mrs. Glass paid bills and wrote letters.
He stood looking out of it, his back to Franny, his hands in his hip pockets again, his
cigar in his mouth. "Did you know I may go to France this summer to make a picture?"
he asked, irritably. "Did I tell you?"
     Franny looked over at his back with interest. "No, you didn't!" she said. "Are you
serious? What picture?"
     Zooey, looking out over the macadamized school roof across the street, said, "Oh, it's
a long story. Some French joker's over here, and he heard the album I did with Philippe. I
had lunch with him one day a couple of weeks ago. A real schnorrer, but sort of likable,
and apparently he's hot over there right now." He put one foot up on the window seat.
"Nothing's final— nothing's ever final with these guys—but I think I've got him half
snowed into the idea of making a picture out of that Lenormand novel. The one I sent
you."
    "Yes! Oh, that's exciting, Zooey. If you go, when do you think you'd go?"
     "It is not exciting. That's exactly the point. I'd enjoy doing it, yes. God, yes. But I'd
hate like hell to leave New York. If you must know, I hate any kind of so-called creative
type who gets on any kind of ship. I don't give a goddam what his reasons are. I was born
here. I went to school here. I've been run over here—twice, and on the same damn street.
I have no business acting in Europe, for God's sake."
     Franny gazed thoughtfully at his white broadcloth back. Her lips, however, were still
silently forming words. "Why do you go, then?" she asked. "If you feel that way."
    "Why do I go?" Zooey said, without looking around. "I go mostly because I'm tired



as hell of getting up furious in the morning and going to bed furious at night. I go because
I sit in judgment on every poor, ulcerous bastard I know. Which in itself doesn't bother
me too much. At least, I judge straight from the colon when I judge, and I know that I'll
pay like hell for any judgment I mete out, sooner or later, one way or another. That
doesn't bother me so much. But there's something—Jesus God—there's something I do to
people's morale downtown that I can't stand to watch much longer. I can tell you exactly
what I do. I make everybody feel that he doesn't really want to do any good work but that
he just wants to get work done that will be thought good by everyone he knows—the
critics, the sponsors, the public, even his children's schoolteacher. That's what I do. That's
the worst I do." He frowned in the direction of the school roof; then, with his fingertips,
pressed some perspiration away from his forehead. He turned, abruptly, toward Franny
when he heard her say something. "What?" he said. "I can't hear you."
    "Nothing. I said 'Oh, God.'"
    "Why 'Oh, God'?" Zooey asked, impatiently.
    "Nothing. Don't jump on me, please. I was only thinking, that's all. I just wish you
could've seen me on Saturday. You talk about undermining people's morale! I absolutely
ruined Lane's whole day. I not only passed out on him every hour on the hour but here I'd
gone all the way up there for a nice, friendly, normal, cocktaily, supposedly happy
football game, and absolutely everything he said I either jumped on or contradicted or—I
don't know—just spoiled." Franny shook her head. She was still stroking Bloomberg, but
absently. The piano appeared to be her focal point. "I simply could not keep a single
opinion to myself," she said. "It was just horrible. Almost from the very second he met
me at the station, I started picking and picking and picking at all his opinions and values
and—just everything. But everything. He'd written some perfectly harmless test-tubey
paper on Flaubert that he was so proud of and wanted me to read, and it just sounded to
me so strictly English Department and patronizing and campusy that all I did was—" She
broke off. She shook her head again, and Zooey, still half-pivoted in her direction,
narrowed his eyes at her. She was looking even paler, more post-operative, as it were,
than she had on waking. "It's a wonder he didn't shoot me," she said. "I'd have absolutely
congratulated him if he had."
    "You told me that bit last night. I don't want any unfresh reminiscences this morning,
buddy," Zooey said, and resumed looking out of the window. "In the first place, you're
way off when you start railing at things and people instead of at yourself. We both are. I
do the same goddam thing about television—I'm aware of that. But it's wrong. It's us. I
keep telling you that. Why are you so damned dense about it?"
    "I'm not so damned dense about it, but you keep—"
     "It's us," Zooey repeated, overriding her. "We're freaks, that's all. Those two bastards
got us nice and early and made us into freaks with freakish standards, that's all. We're the
Tattooed Lady, and we're never going to have a minute's peace, the rest of our lives, till
everybody else is tattooed, too." More than a trifle grimly, he brought his cigar to his
mouth and dragged on it, but it had gone out. "On top of everything else," he said
immediately, "we've got 'Wise Child' complexes. We've never really got off the goddam
air. Not one of us. We don't talk, we hold forth. We don't converse, we expound. At least
I do. The minute I'm in a room with somebody who has the usual number of ears, I either


turn into a goddam seer or a human hatpin. The Prince of Bores. Last night, for instance.
Down at the San Remo. I kept praying that Hess wouldn't tell me the plot of his new
script. I knew damn well he had one. I knew damn well I wasn't going to get out of the
place without a new script to take home. But I kept praying he'd spare me from an oral
preview. He's not stupid. He knows it's impossible for me to keep my mouth shut." Zooey
suddenly, sharply, turned around, without taking his foot off the window seat, and picked
up, snatched up, a match folder that was on his mother's writing table. He turned back to
the window and the view of the school roof and put his cigar into his mouth again—but at
once took it out. "Damn him, anyway," he said. "He's so stupid it breaks your heart. He's
like everybody else in television. And Hollywood. And Broadway. He thinks everything
sentimental is tender, everything brutal is a slice of realism, and everything that runs into
physical violence is a legitimate climax to something that isn't even—"
    "Did you tell him that?"
      "Certainly I told him that! I just got through telling you I can't keep my mouth shut.
Certainly I told him that! I left him sitting there wishing he was dead. Or one of us was
dead— I hope to hell it was me. Anyway, it was a true San Remo exit." Zooey took down
his foot from the window seat. He turned around, looking both tense and agitated, and
pulled out the straight chair at his mother's writing table and sat down. He relit his cigar,
then hunched forward, restively, both arms on the cherrywood surface. An object his
mother used as a paperweight stood beside the inkwell: a small glass sphere, on a black
plastic pedestal, containing a snowman wearing a stovepipe hat. Zooey picked it up, gave
it a shake, and sat apparently watching the snowflakes swirl.
     Franny, looking at him, now had a hand vi-sored over her eyes. Zooey was sitting in
the main shaft of sunlight in the room. She might have altered her position on the couch,
if she meant to go on looking at him, but that would have disturbed Bloomberg, in her
lap, who appeared to be asleep. "Do you really have an ulcer?" she asked suddenly.
"Mother said you have an ulcer."
     "Yes, I have an ulcer, for Chrissake. This is Kaliyuga, buddy, the Iron Age. Anybody
over sixteen without an ulcer's a goddam spy." He gave the snowman another, more
vigorous shake. "The funny part is," he said, "I like Hess. Or at least I like him when he's
not shoving his artistic poverty down my throat. At least he wears horrible neckties and
funny padded suits in the middle of that frightened, super-conservative, super-
conforming madhouse. And I like his conceit. He's so conceited he's actually humble, the
crazy bastard. I mean he obviously thinks television's good enough to deserve him and
his big, bogus-courageous, 'offbeat' talent—which is a crazy kind of humility, if you
feel like thinking about it." He stared at the glass ball till the snowstorm had abated
somewhat. "In a way, I sort of like LeSage, too. Everything he owns is the best—his
overcoat, his two-cabin cruiser, his son's grades at Harvard, his electric razor, everything.
He took me home to dinner once and stopped me in the driveway to ask me if I
remembered 'the late Carole Lombard, in the movies.' He warned me I'd get a shock
when I met his wife, she was such a dead ringer for Carole Lombard. I suppose I'll like
him for that till I die. His wife turned out to be a really tired, bosomy, Persian-looking
blonde." Zooey looked around abruptly at Franny, who had said something. "What?" he
asked.


  "Yes!" Franny repeated—pale, but beaming, and apparently fated, too, to like Mr.
LeSage till death.
      Zooey smoked his cigar in silence for a moment. "What gets me so down about Dick
Hess," he said, "what makes me so sad, or furious, or whatever the hell I am, is that the
first script he did for LeSage was pretty good. It was almost good, in fact. It was the first
one we did on film—I don't think you saw it, you were at school or something. I played a
young farmer in it who lives all alone with his father. The boy has a notion that he hates
farming, and he and his father have always had a terrible time making a living, so when
the father dies, he sells all the cattle and makes big plans to go to the big city to make a
living," Zooey picked up the snowman again but didn't give it a shake-merely turned it
around, by the pedestal. "It had some nice bits," he said. "After I sell all the cows, I keep
going out to the pasture to look for them. And when I go for a farewell walk with my girl,
right before I leave for the big city, I keep steering her over toward the empty pasture.
Then, when I get to the big city and get a job, I spend all my spare time hanging around
the stockyards. Finally, in heavy traffic on the main street in the big city, a car makes a
left turn and changes into a cow. I run after it, just as the light changes, and get run
over—stampeded." He gave the snowman a shake. "It probably wasn't anything you
couldn't watch while you were cutting your toenails, but at least you didn't feel like
slinking home from the studio after rehearsals. It was fresh enough, at least, and it was his
own, it wasn't part of a hackneyed trend in scripts. I wish to hell he'd go home and fill up
again. I wish to hell every-body'd go home. I'm sick to death of being the heavy in
everybody's life. God, you should see Hess and LeSage when they're talking about a new
show. Or a new anything. They're as happy as pigs till I show up. I feel like those dismal
bastards Seymour's beloved Chuang-tzu warned everybody against. 'Beware when the so-
called sagely men come limping into sight.'" He sat still, watching the snowflakes swirl.
"I could happily lie down and die sometimes," he said.
     Franny at that moment was gazing at a sunlit faded spot in the carpet over near the
piano, her lips very discernibly moving. "This is all so funny, you can't imagine," she
said, with the faintest tremor in her voice, and Zooey looked over at her. Her paleness
was emphasized by the fact that she was wearing no lipstick at all. "Everything you're
saying brings back everything I was frying to say to Lane on Saturday, when he started
digging at me. Right in the middle of Martinis and snails and things. I mean we're not
bothered by exactly the same things, but by the same kind of things, I think, and for the
same reasons. At least, it sounds that way." Bloomberg just then stood up in her lap and,
more like a dog than a cat, began to circle around to find a sleeping position he liked
better. Franny absently, yet like a guide, placed her hands gently on his back, and went on
speaking. "I actually reached a point where I said to myself, right out loud, like a lunatic,
If I hear just one more picky, cavilling, unconstructive word out of you, Franny Glass,
you and I are finished—but finished. And for a while I wasn't too bad. For about a whole
month, at least, whenever anybody said anything that sounded campusy and phony, or
that smelled to high heaven of ego or something like that, I at least kept quiet about it. I
went to the movies or I stayed in the library all hours or I started writing papers like mad
on Restoration Comedy and stuff like that—but at least I had the pleasure of not hearing
my own voice for a while," She shook her head. "Then, one morning—bang, bang, I
started up again. I didn't sleep all night, for some reason, and I had an eight-o'clock in
French Lit, so finally I just got up and got dressed and made some coffee and then walked

around the campus. What I wanted to do was just go for a terribly long ride on my bike,
but I was afraid everybody'd hear me taking my bike out of the stand—something always
falls—so I just went to the Lit building and sat. I sat and sat, and finally I got up and
started writing things from Epictetus all over the blackboard. I filled the whole front
blackboard—I didn't even know I'd remembered so much of him. I erased it—thank God!
—before people started coming in. But it was a childish thing to do anyway—Epictetus
would have absolutely hated me for doing it—but ..." Franny hesitated. "I don't know. I
think I just wanted to see the name of somebody nice up on a blackboard. Anyway, that
started me up again. I picked all day. I picked on Professor Fallon. I picked on Lane
when I talked to him on the phone. I picked on Professor Tupper. It got worse and worse.
I even started picking on my roommate. Oh, God, poor Bev! I started catching her
looking at me as if she hoped I'd decide to move out of the room and let somebody
halfway pleasant and normal move in and give her a little peace. It was just terrible! And
the worst part was, I knew what a bore I was being, I knew how I was depressing people,
or even hurting their feelings—but I just couldn't stop! I just could not stop picking."
Looking more than a little distrait, she paused just long enough to push downward on
Bloomberg's roving hindquarters. "It was the worst of all in class, though," she said with
decision. "That was the worst. What happened was, I got the idea in my head—and I
could not get it out—that college was just one more dopey, inane place in the world
dedicated to piling up treasure on earth and everything. I mean treasure is treasure, for
heaven's sake. What's the difference whether the treasure is money, or property, or even
culture, or even just plain knowledge? It all seemed like exactly the same thing to me, if
you take off the wrapping—and it still does! Sometimes I think that knowledge—when
it's knowledge for knowledge's sake, anyway—is the worst of all. The least excusable,
certainly." Nervously, and without any real need whatever, Franny pushed back her hair
with one hand. "I don't think it would have all got me quite so down if just once in a
while—just once in a while—there was at least some polite little perfunctory implication
that knowledge should lead to wisdom, and that if it doesn't, it's just a disgusting waste of
time! But there never is! You never even hear any hints dropped on a campus that
wisdom is supposed to be the goal of knowledge. You hardly ever even hear the word
'wisdom' mentioned! Do you want to hear something funny? Do you want to hear
something really funny? In almost four years of college—and this is the absolute truth —
in almost four years of college, the only time I can remember ever even hearing the
expression 'wise man' being used was in my freshman year, in Political Science! And you
know how it was used? It was used in reference to some nice old poopy elder statesman
who'd made a fortune in the stock market and then gone to Washington to be an adviser
to President Roosevelt. Honestly, now! Four years of college, almost! I'm not saying that
happens to everybody, but I just get so upset when I think about it I could die." She broke
off, and apparently became re-dedicated to serving Bloomberg's interests. Her lips now
had very little more color in them than her face. They were also, very faintly, chapped.
Zooey's eyes were on her, and had been. "I want to ask you something, Franny," he said
abruptly. He turned back to the writing-table surface again, frowned, and gave the
snowman a shake. "What do you think you're doing with the Jesus Prayer?" he asked.
"This is what I was trying to get at last night. Before you told me to go chase myself. You
talk about piling up treasure—money, property, culture, knowledge, and so on and so on.
In going ahead with the Jesus Prayer—just let me finish, now, please—in going ahead


with the Jesus Prayer, aren't you trying to lay up some kind of treasure? Something that's
every goddam bit as negotiable as all those other, more material things? Or does the fact
that it's a prayer make all the difference? I mean by that, is there all the difference in the
world, for you, in which side somebody lays up his treasure—this side, or the other? The
one where thieves can't break in, et cetera? Is that what makes the difference? Wait a
second, now— just wait'll I'm finished, please." He sat for a few seconds watching the
little blizzard in the glass sphere. Then: "There's something about the way you're going at
this prayer that gives me the willies, if you want to know the truth. You think I'm out to
stop you from saying it. I don't know whether I am or not—that's a goddam debatable
point—but I would like you to clear up for me just what the hell your motives are for
saying it." He hesitated, but not long enough to give Franny a chance to cut in on him.
"As a matter of simple logic, there's no difference at all, that I can see, between the man
who's greedy for material treasure—or even intellectual treasure—and the man who's
greedy for spiritual treasure. As you say, treasure's treasure, God damn it, and it seems to
me that ninety per cent of all the world-hating saints in history were just as acquisitive
and unattractive, basically, as the rest of us are."
    Franny said, as icily as she could with a faint
    tremor in her voice, "May I interrupt now, Zooey?"
    Zooey let go the snowman and picked up a pencil to play with. "Yes, yes. Interrupt,"
he said.
     "I know all you're saying. You're not telling me one thing I haven't thought of by
myself. You're saying I want something from the Jesus Prayer—which makes me just as
acquisitive, in your word, really, as somebody who wants a sable coat, or to be famous,
or to be dripping with some kind of crazy prestige. I know all thatl My gosh, what kind of
an imbecile do you think I am?" The tremor in her voice amounted now almost to an
impediment.
    "All right, take it easy, take it easy."
    "I can't take it easy! You make me so mad! What do you think I'm doing here in this
crazy room—losing weight like mad, worrying Bessie and Les absolutely silly, upsetting
the house, and everything? Don't you think I have sense enough to worry about my
motives for saying the prayer? That's exactly what's bothering me so. Just because I'm
choosy about what I want— in this case, enlightenment, or peace, instead of money or
prestige or fame or any of those things —doesn't mean I'm not as egotistical and self-
seeking as everybody else. If anything, I'm more so! I don't need the famous Zachary
Glass to tell me that!" Here there was a marked break in her voice, and she began to be
very attentive to Bloomberg again. Tears, presumably, were imminent, if not already on
the way.
     Over at the writing table, Zooey, pressing down heavily with his pencil, was filling
in the "o"s on the advertisement side of a small blotter. He kept this up for a little
interval, then flipped the pencil toward the inkwell. He picked up his cigar from the lip of
the copper ashtray where he had placed it. It was now only about two inches in length but
was still burning. He took a deep drag on it, as if it were a kind of respirator in an
otherwise oxygenless world. Then, almost forcibly, he looked over at Franny again. "Do


you want me to try to get Buddy on the phone for you tonight?" he asked. "I think you
should talk to somebody—I'm no damn good for this." He waited, looking at her steadily.
"Franny. What about it?"
     Franny's head was bowed. She appeared to be searching for fleas in Bloomberg's
coat, her fingers very busy indeed turning back tufts of fur. She was in fact crying now,
but in a very local sort of way, as it were; there were tears but no sounds. Zooey watched
her for a full minute or so, then said, not precisely kindly, but without importuning,
"Franny. What about it? Shall I try to get Buddy on the phone?"
     She shook her head, without raising it. She went on searching for fleas. Then, after
an interval, she did reply to Zooey's question, but not very audibly.
    "What?" Zooey asked.
    Franny repeated her statement. "I want to talk to Seymour," she said.
     Zooey went on looking at her for a moment, his face essentially expressionless—
discounting a line of perspiration on his rather long and singularly Irish upper lip. Then,
with characteristic abruptness, he turned back and resumed filling in "o"s. But he put
down the pencil almost immediately. He got up from the writing table—rather slowly, for
him—and, taking his cigar stub with him, reassumed his one-foot-up stance at the
window seat. A taller, longer-legged man—any one of his brothers, for example— might
have put his foot up, might have made the stretch, with greater ease. But once Zooey's
foot was up, he gave the impression of sustaining a dancer's position.
     At first piecemeal, then point-blank, he let his attention be drawn to a little scene that
was being acted out sublimely, unhampered by writers and directors and producers, five
stories below the window and across the street. A fair-sized maple tree stood in front of
the girls' private school—one of four or five trees on that fortunate side of the street—and
at the moment a child of seven or eight, female, was hiding behind it. She was wearing a
navy-blue reefer and a tam that was very nearly the same shade of red as the blanket on
the bed in van Gogh's room at Aries. Her tam did, in fact, from Zooey's vantage point,
appear not unlike a dab of paint. Some fifteen feet away from the child, her dog—a
young dachshund, wearing a green leather collar and leash—was sniffing to find her,
scurrying in frantic circles, his leash dragging behind him. The anguish of separation was
scarcely bearable for him, and when at last he picked up his mistress's scent, it wasn't a
second too soon. The joy of reunion, for both, was immense. The dachshund gave a little
yelp, then cringed forward, shimmying with ecstasy, till his mistress, shouting something
at him, stepped hurriedly over the wire guard surrounding the tree and picked him up.
She said a number of words of praise to him, in the private argot of the game, then put
him down and picked up his leash, and the two walked gaily west, toward Fifth Avenue
and the Park and out of Zooey's sight. Zooey reflexively put his hand on a cross-piece
between panes of glass, as if he had a mind to raise the window and lean out of it to
watch the two disappear. It was his cigar hand, however, and he hesitated a second too
long. He dragged on his cigar. "God damn it," he said, "there are nice things in the
world—and I mean nice things. We're all such morons to get so sidetracked. Always,
always, always referring every goddam thing that happens right back to our lousy little
egos." Behind him, just then, Franny blew her nose with guileless abandon; the report
was considerably louder than might have been expected from so fine and delicate-


appearing an organ. Zooey turned around to look at her, somewhat censoriously.
     Franny, busy with several folds of Kleenex, looked at him. "Well, I'm sorry," she
said, "Can't I blow my nose?"
    "You finished?"
     "Yes, I'm finished! My gosh, what a family. You take your life in your hands if you
just blow your nose."
     Zooey turned back to the window. He smoked briefly, his eyes following a pattern of
concrete blocks in the school building. "Buddy once said something reasonably sensible
to me a couple of years ago," he said. "If I can remember what it was." He hesitated. And
Franny, though still busy with her Kleenex, looked over at him. When Zooey appeared to
have difficulty in remembering something, his hesitation invariably interested all his
brothers and sisters, and even held some entertainment value for them. His hesitations
were almost always specious. Most of the time, they were direct carry-overs from the five
undoubtedly formative years he had spent as a regular panelist on "It's a Wise Child,"
when, rather than seem to flaunt his somewhat preposterous ability to quote,
instantaneously and, usually, verbatim, almost anything he had ever read, or even listened
to, with genuine interest, he cultivated a habit of furrowing his brow and appearing to
stall for time, the way the other children on the program did. His brow was furrowed
now, but he spoke up rather more quickly than was customary under the circumstances,
as though he sensed that Franny, his old co-panelist, had caught him at it. "He said that a
man should be able to lie at the bottom of a hill with his throat cut, slowly bleeding to
death, and if a pretty girl or an old woman should pass by with a beautiful jug balanced
perfectly on the top of her head, he should be able to raise himself up on one arm and see
the jug safely over the top of the hill." He thought this over, then gave a mild snort. "I'd
like to see him do it, the bastard." He took a drag on his cigar. "Everybody in this family
gets his goddam religion in a different package," he commented, with a notable absence
of awe in his tone. "Walt was a hot one. Walt and Boo Boo had the hottest religious
philosophies in the family." He dragged on his cigar, as if to offset being amused when
he didn't care to be. "Walt once told Waker that everybody in the family must have piled
up one helluva lot of bad karma in his past incarnations. He had a theory, Walt, that the
religious life, and all the agony that goes with it, is just something God sicks on people
who have the gall to accuse Him of having created an ugly world."
     A titter of audience appreciation came from the couch. "I never heard that," Franny
said. "What's Boo Boo's religious philosophy? I didn't think she had any."
     Zooey said nothing for a moment, and then: "Boo Boo's? Boo Boo's convinced Mr.
Ashe made the world. She got it from Kilvert's 'Diary.' The schoolchildren in Kilvert's
parish were asked who made the world, and one of the kids answered, 'Mr. Ashe.'"
    Franny was delighted, and audibly so. Zooey turned and looked at her, and—
unpredictable young man—made a very dour face, as though he had suddenly eschewed
any and all forms o£ levity. He took down his foot from the window seat, parked his
cigar end in the copper ashtray on the writing table, and came away from the window. He
moved across the room slowly, hands in his hip pockets, but not without some direction
in his mind. "I should get the hell out of here. I've got a lunch date," he said, and


immediately stooped to make a leisurely and proprietary examination of the interior of
the fish tank. He tapped on the glass with his fingernail, importunately. "I turn my back
for five minutes and everybody lets my black mollies die off. I should've taken them to
college with me. I knew that."
    "Oh, Zooey. You've been saying that for five years. Why don't you go buy some new
ones?"
     He went on tapping on the glass. "All you college snips are the same. Hard as nails.
These weren't just any black mollies, buddy. We were very close." So saying, he
stretched out on his back on the carpet again, his slight torso fitting in rather tightly
between the 1932 Stromberg-Carlson table radio and an overfilled maple magazine stand.
Again only the soles and heels of his brogues were visible to Franny. However, no sooner
was he stretched out than he sat bolt upright, his head and shoulders suddenly propelled
into view, with somewhat the macabre-comic effect of a corpse falling out of a closet.
"Prayer's still going, eh?" he said. Then he dropped back out of sight again. He was still
for a moment. Then, in an almost unintelligibly thick Mayfair accent: "I'd rather like a
word with you, Miss Glass, if you've a moment." The response to this, over at the couch,
was a distinctly ominous silence. "Say your prayer if you want to, or play with
Bloomberg, or feel free to smoke, but give me five minutes of uninterrupted silence,
buddy. And, if possible, no tears at all. O.K.? You hear me?"
    Franny didn't answer straightway. She brought her legs in closer to her, under the
afghan. And gathered in the sleeping Bloomberg somewhat closer to her, too. "I hear
you," she said, and drew her legs in still closer to her, as a fortress draws up its bridge
before the siege. She hesitated, then spoke up again. "You can say anything you want if
you don't get abusive about it. I just don't feel like a workout this morning. I mean it."
    "No workouts, no workouts, buddy. And if there's one thing I never am, it's abusive."
The speaker's hands were folded benignly on his chest. "Oh, a little brisk sometimes, yes,
when the situation warrants. Abusive, never. Personally, I've always found that you can
catch more flies with—"
    "I mean it, now, Zooey," Franny said, more or less addressing his brogues. "And I
wish you'd sit up, incidentally. Every time all hell breaks loose around here, it seems very
funny to me that it always comes from that spot right where you're lying. And you're
always the one that's there. C'mon, now. Just please sit up."
    Zooey closed his eyes. "Fortunately, I know you don't mean that. Not deep down.
We both know, deep in our hearts, that this is the only piece of hallowed ground in this
whole goddam haunted house. This happens to be where I used to keep my rabbits. And
they were saints, both of them. As a matter of fact, they were the only celibate rabbits in
the—"
    "Oh, shut up!" Franny said, nervously. "Just start, if you're going to. All I ask is that
you at least try to be a little bit tactful, the way I'm feeling right now—that's all. You are
without a doubt the most tactless person I've ever known in my life."
    "Tactless! Never. Outspoken, yes. High-spirited, yes. Mettlesome. Sanguine,
perhaps, to a fault. But no one has ever—"
    "I said tactlessl" Franny overrode him. With considerable heat, yet trying not to be


amused. "Just get sick sometime and go visit yourself, and you'll find out how tactless
you are! You're the most impossible person to have around when somebody's not feeling
up to par that I've ever known in my life. If somebody just has a cold, even, you know
what you do? You give them a dirty look every time you see them. You're absolutely the
most unsympathetic person I've ever known. You are!"
     "All right, all right, all right," Zooey said, with his eyes still closed. "Nobody's
perfect, buddy." Effortlessly, by softening and thinning his voice, rather than by raising it
to a falsetto, he gave what was to Franny a familiar and always realistic imitation of their
mother passing along a few cautionary words: "We say many things in heat, young lady,
that we don't really mean and are very sorry for the next day." Then, instantly, he
frowned, opened his eyes, and stared for several seconds at the ceiling. "Firstly," he said,
"I think you think I have intentions of trying to take your prayer away from you or
something. I don't. I do not. You can lie on that couch reciting the preamble to the
Constitution for the rest of your life, as far as I'm concerned, but what I am trying—"
    "That's a beautiful start. Just beautitul."
    "Beg pardon?"
    "Oh, shut up. Just go on, go on."
     "What I started to say, I have nothing against the prayer at all. No matter what you
think. You're not the first one who ever thought of saying it, you know. I once went to
every Army & Navy store in New York looking for a nice, pilgrim-type rucksack. I was
going to fill it with bread crumbs and start walking all over the goddam country. Saying
the prayer. Spreading the Word. The whole business." Zooey hesitated. "And I don't just
mention it, for God's sake, to show you I was once an Emotional Young Person Just Like
Yourself."
    "Why do you mention it, then?"
     "Why do I mention it? I mention it because I have a couple of things I want to say to
you, and it's just possible I'm not qualified to say them. On the ground that I once had a
strong desire to say the prayer myself but didn't. For all I know, I may be a little jealous
of your having a go at it. It's very possible, in fact. In the first place, I'm a ham. It may
very well be that I hate like hell to play Martha to somebody else's Mary. Who the hell
knows?"
    Franny didn't choose to reply. But she drew Bloomberg slightly closer to her and
gave him an odd, ambiguous little hug. Then she looked over in her brother's direction,
and said, "You're a brownie. Did you know that?"
      "Just hold the compliments, buddy—you may live to retract them. I'm still going to
tell you what I don't like about the way you're going at this business. Qualified or not."
Here Zooey stared blankly at the plaster ceiling for a matter of ten seconds or so, then
closed his eyes again. "Firstly," he said, "I don't like this Camille routine. And don't
interrupt me, now. I know you're legitimately falling apart, and all that. And I don't think
it's an act—I don't mean that. And I don't think it's a subconscious plea for sympathy. Or
any of that business. But I still say I don't like it. It's rough on Bessie, it's rough on Les—
and if you don't know it yet, you're beginning to give off a little stink of piousness. God
damn it, there isn't any prayer in any religion in the world that justifies piousness. I'm not


saying you are pious—so just sit still—but I am saying all this hysteria business is
unattractive as hell."
     "Are you finished?" Franny said, sitting very notably forward. The tremor had
returned to her voice.
     "All right, Franny. C'mon, now. You said you'd hear me out. I've said the worst, I
think. I'm just trying to tell you—I'm not trying, I'm telling you—that this just is not fair
to Bessie and Les. It's terrible for them—and you know it. Did you know, God damn it,
that Les was all for bringing a tangerine in to you last night before he went to bed? My
God. Even Bessie can't stand stories with tangerines in them. And God knows I can't. If
you're going to go on with this breakdown business, I wish to hell you'd go back to
college to have it. Where you're not the baby of the family. And where, God knows,
nobody'll have any urges to bring you any tangerines. And where you don't keep your
goddam tap shoes in the closet."
     Franny, at this point, reached rather blindly, but soundlessly, for the box of Kleenex
on the marble coffee table.
     Zooey was now gazing abstractedly at an old root-beer stain on the ceiling plaster,
which he himself had made nineteen or twenty years earlier, with a water pistol. "The
next thing that bothers me," he said, "isn't pretty, either. But I'm almost finished, so hang
on a second if you can. What I don't like at all is this little hair-shirty private life of a
martyr you're living back at college—this little snotty crusade you think you're leading
against everybody. And I don't mean what you may think I mean, so try not to interrupt
for a second. I take it that mostly you're gunning against the system of higher education.
Don't spring at me, now— for the most part, I agree with you. But I hate the kind of
blanket attack you're making on it. I agree with you about ninety-eight per cent on the
issue. But the other two per cent scares me half to death. I had one professor when I was
in college—just one, I'll grant you, but he was a big, big one—who just doesn't fit in with
anything you've been talking about. He wasn't Epictetus. But he was no egomaniac, he
was no faculty charm boy. He was a great and modest scholar. And what's more, I don't
think I ever heard him say anything, either in or out of a classroom, that didn't seem to
me to have a little bit of real wisdom in it—and sometimes a lot of it. What'll happen to
him when you start your revolution? I can't bear to think about it—let's change the
goddam subject. These other people you've been ranting about are something else again.
This Professor Tupper. And those other two goons you were telling me about last night
—Manlius, and the other one. I've had them by the dozens, and so has everybody else,
and I agree they're not harmless. They're lethal as hell, as a matter of fact. God almighty.
They make everything they touch turn absolutely academic and useless. Or—worse—
cultish. To my mind, they're mostly to blame for the mob of ignorant oafs with diplomas
that are turned loose on the country every June." Here Zooey, still looking at the ceiling,
simultaneously grimaced and shook his head. "But what I don't like —and what I don't
think either Seymour or Buddy would like, either, as a matter of fact— is the way you
talk about all these people. I mean you don't just despise what they represent —you
despise them. It's too damn personal, Franny. I mean it. You get a real little homicidal
glint in your eye when you talk about this Tupper, for instance. All this business about his
going into the men's room to muss his hair before he comes in to class. All that. He
probably does—it goes with everything else you've told me about him. I'm not saying it


doesn't. But it's none of your business, buddy, what he does with his hair. It would be all
right, in a way, if you thought his personal affectations were sort of funny. Or if you felt a
tiny bit sorry for him for being insecure enough to give himself a little pathetic goddam
glamour. But when you tell me about it—and I'm not fooling, now—you tell me about it
as though his hair was a goddam personal enemy of yours. That is not right—and you
know it. If you're going to go to war against the System, just do your shooting like a nice,
intelligent girl—because the enemy's there, and not because you don't like his hairdo or
his goddam necktie."
    A silence followed for a minute or so. It was broken only by the sound of Franny
blowing her nose—an abandoned, protracted, "congested" blow, suggestive of a patient
with a four-day-old head cold.
      "It's exactly like this damned ulcer I picked up. Do you know why I have it? Or at
least nine-tenths of the reason I have it? Because when I'm not thinking properly, I let my
feelings about television and everything else get personal. I do exactly the same thing you
do, and I'm old enough to know better." Zooey paused. His gaze fixed on the root-beer
spot, he took a deep breath, through his nose. His fingers were still laced across his chest.
"This last thing," he said abruptly, "will probably cause an explosion. But I can't help it.
It's the most important thing of all." He appeared to consult the ceiling plaster briefly,
then closed his eyes. "I don't know if you remember, but I remember a time around here,
buddy, when you were going through a little apostasy from the New Testament that could
be heard for miles around. Everybody was in the goddam Army at the time, and I was the
one that got his ear bent. But do you remember? Do you remember it at all?"
    "I was all of ten years old!" Franny said— nasally, rather dangerously.
    "I know how old you were. I know very well how old you were. C'mon, now. I'm not
bringing this up with the idea of throwing anything back in your teeth—my God. I'm
bringing this up for a good reason. I'm bringing it up because I don't think you understood
Jesus when you were a child and I don't think you understand him now. I think you've got
him confused in your mind with about five or ten other religious personages, and I don't
see how you can go ahead with the Jesus Prayer till you know who's who and what's
what. Do you remember at all what started off that little apostasy? . . . Franny? Do you
remember, or don't you?"
    He didn't get an answer. Only the sound of a nose being rather violently blown.
      "Well, I do, it happens. Matthew, Chapter Six. I remember it very clearly, buddy. I
even remember where I was. I was back in my room putting some friction tape on my
goddam hockey stick, and you banged in—all in an uproar, with the Bible wide open.
You didn't like Jesus any more, and you wanted to know if you could call Seymour at his
Army camp and tell him all about it. And you know why you didn't like Jesus any more?
I'll tell you. Because, one, you didn't approve of his going into the synagogue and
throwing all the tables and idols all over the place. That was very rude, very Unnecessary.
You were sure that Solomon or somebody wouldn't have done anything like that. And the
other thing you disapproved of—the thing you had the Bible open to—was the lines
'Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;
yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.' That was all right. That was lovely. That you
approved of. But, when Jesus says in the same breath, 'Are ye not much better than


they?'—ah, that's where little Franny gets off. That's where little Franny quits the Bible
cold and goes straight to Buddha, who doesn't discriminate against all those nice fowls of
the air. All those sweet, lovely chickens and geese that we used to keep up at the Lake.
And don't tell me again that you were ten years old. Your age has nothing to do with what
I'm talking about. There are no big changes between ten and twenty—or ten and eighty,
for that matter. You still can't love a Jesus as much as you'd like to who did and said a
couple of things he was at least reported to have said or done—and you know it. You're
constitutionally unable to love or understand any son of God who throws tables around.
And you're constitutionally unable to love or understand any son of God who says a
human being, any human being—even a Professor Tupper—is more valuable to God than
any soft, helpless Easter chick."
    Franny was now facing directly into the sound of Zooey's voice, sitting bolt upright,
a wad of Kleenex clenched in one hand. Bloomberg was no longer in her lap. "I suppose
you can," she said, shrilling.
     "It's beside the point whether / can or not. But, yes, as a matter of fact, I can. I don't
feel like going into it, but at least I've never tried, consciously or otherwise, to turn Jesus
into St. Francis of Assisi to make him more 'lovable'— which is exactly what ninety-eight
per cent of the Christian world has always insisted on doing. Not that it's to my credit. I
don't happen to be attracted to the St. Francis of Assisi type. But you are. And, in my
opinion, that's one of the reasons why you're having this little nervous breakdown. And
especially the reason why you're having it at home. This place is made to order for you.
The service is good, and there's plenty of hot and cold running ghosts. What could be
more convenient? You can say your prayer here and roll Jesus and St. Francis and
Seymour and Heidi's grandfather all in one." Zooey's voice stopped, very briefly. "Can't
you see that? Can't you see how unclearly, how sloppily, you're looking at things? My
God, there's absolutely nothing tenth-rate about you, and yet you're up to your neck at
this minute in tenth-rate thinking. Not only is the way you're going at your prayer tenth-
rate religion but, whether you know it or not, you're having a tenth-rate nervous
breakdown. I've seen a couple of real breakdowns, and the people who had them didn't
bother to pick and choose the place they—"
    "Just stop it, Zooey! Just stop it!" Franny said, sobbing.
     "I will, in a minute, in just a minute. Why are you breaking down, incidentally? I
mean if you're able to go into a collapse with all your might, why can't you use the same
energy to stay well and busy? All right, so I'm being unreasonable. I'm being very
unreasonable now. But, my God, how you try what little patience I was born with I You
take a look around your college campus, and the world, and politics, and one season of
summer stock, and you listen to the conversation of a bunch of nitwit college students,
and you decide that everything's ego, ego, ego, and the only intelligent thing for a girl to
do is to lie around and shave her head and say the Jesus Prayer and beg God for a little
mystical experience that'll make her nice and happy."
    Franny shrieked, "Will you shut up, please?" "In just a second, in just a second. You
keep talking about ego. My God, it would take Christ himself to decide what's ego and
what isn't. This is God's universe, buddy, not yours, and he has the final say about what's
ego and what isn't. What about your beloved Epictetus? Or your beloved Emily


Dickinson? You want your Emily, every time she has an urge to write a poem, to just sit
down and say a prayer till her nasty, egotistical urge goes away? No, of course you don't!
But you'd like your friend Professor Tupper's ego taken away from him. That's different.
And maybe it is. Maybe it is. But don't go screaming about egos in general. In my
opinion, if you really want to know, half the nastiness in the world is stirred up by people
who aren't using their true egos. Take your Professor Tupper. From what you say about
him, anyway, I'd lay almost any odds that this thing he's using, the thing you think is his
ego, isn't his ego at all but some other, much dirtier, much less basic faculty. My God,
you've been around schools long enough to know the score. Scratch an incompetent
schoolteacher—or, for that matter, college professor—and half the time you find a
displaced first-class automobile mechanic or a goddam stonemason. Take LeSage, for
instance— my friend, my employer, my Rose of Madison Avenue. You think it was his
ego that got him into television? Like hell it was I He has no ego any more—if ever he
had one. He's split it up into hobbies. He has at least three hobbies that I know of—and
they all have to do with a big, ten-thousand-dollar workroom in his basement, full of
power tools and vises and God knows what else. Nobody who's really using his ego, his
real ego, has any time for any goddam hobbies." Zooey suddenly broke off. He was still
lying with his eyes closed and his fingers laced, quite tightly, across his chest, his shirt-
front. But he now ground his face into a deliberately pained expression—a form,
apparently, of self-criticism. "Hobbies," he said. "How did I get off onto hobbies?" He
lay still for a moment.
     Franny's sobs, no more than partly muffled by a satin pillow, made the only sound in
the room. Bloomberg was now sitting under the piano, on an island of sunshine, rather
picturesquely washing his face.
     "Always the heavy," Zooey said, a trifle too matter-of-factly. "No matter what I say,
I sound as though I'm undermining your Jesus Prayer. And I'm not, God damn it. All I am
is against why and how and where you're using it. I'd like to be convinced—I'd love to be
convinced— that you're not using it as a substitute for doing whatever the hell your duty
is in life, or just your daily duty. Worse than that, though, I can't see—I swear to God I
can't—how you can pray to a Jesus you don't even understand. And what's really
inexcusable, considering that you've been funnel-fed on just about the same amount of
religious philosophy that I have—what's really inexcusable is that you don't try to
understand him. There'd be some excuse for it if you were either a very simple person,
like the pilgrim, or a very goddam desperate person—but you're not simple, buddy, and
you're not that damned desperate." Just then, for the first time since he had lain down,
Zooey, with his eyes still shut, compressed his lips—very much, as a matter of
parenthetical fact, in the habitual style of his mother. "God almighty, Franny," he said. "If
you're going to say the Jesus Prayer, at least say it to Jesus, and not to St. Francis and
Seymour and Heidi's grandfather all wrapped up in one. Keep him in mind if you say it,
and him only, and him as he was and not as you'd like him to have been. You don't face
any facts. This same damned attitude of not facing facts is what got you into this messy
state of mind in the first place, and it can't possibly get you out of it."
     Zooey abruptly placed his hands over his now quite damp face, left them there for an
instant, then removed them. He refolded them. His voice picked up again, almost
perfectly conversational in tone. "The part that stumps me, really stumps me, is that I

can't see why anybody—unless he was a child, or an angel, or a lucky simpleton like the
pilgrim—would even want to say the prayer to a Jesus who was the least bit different
from the way he looks and sounds in the New Testament. My God! He's only the most
intelligent man in the Bible, that's all! Who isn't he head and shoulders over? Who? Both
Testaments are full of pundits, prophets, disciples, favorite sons, Solomons, Isaiahs,
Davids, Pauls —but, my God, who besides Jesus really knew which end was up? Nobody.
Not Moses. Don't tell me Moses. He was a nice man, and he kept in beautiful touch with
his God, and all that— but that's exactly the point. He had to keep in touch. Jesus realized
there is no separation from God." Zooey here clapped his hands together— only once,
and not loud, and very probably in spite of himself. His hands were refolded across his
chest almost, as it were, before the clap was out. "Oh, my God, what a mind!" he said.
"Who else, for example, would have kept his mouth shut when Pilate asked for an
explanation? Not Solomon. Don't say Solomon. Solomon would have had a few pithy
words for the occasion. I'm not sure Socrates wouldn't have, for that matter. Crito, or
somebody, would have managed to pull him aside just long enough to get a couple of
well-chosen words for the record. But most of all, above everything else, who in the
Bible besides Jesus knew—knew—that we're carrying the Kingdom of Heaven around
with us, inside, where we're all too goddam stupid and sentimental and unimaginative to
look? You have to be a son of God to know that kind of stuff. Why don't you think of
these things? I mean it, Franny, I'm being serious. When you don't see Jesus for exactly
what he was, you miss the whole point of the Jesus Prayer. If you don't understand Jesus,
you can't understand his prayer—you don't get the prayer at all, you just get some kind of
organized cant. Jesus was a supreme adept, by God, on a terribly important mission. This
was no St. Francis, with enough time to knock out a few canticles, or to preach to the
birds, or to do any of the other endearing things so close to Franny Glass's heart. I'm
being serious now, God damn it. How can you miss seeing that? If God had wanted
somebody with St. Francis's consistently winning personality for the job in the New
Testament, he'd've picked him, you can be sure. As it was, he picked the best, the
smartest, the most loving, the least sentimental, the most unimitative master he could
possibly have picked. And when you miss seeing that, I swear to you, you're missing the
whole point of the Jesus Prayer. The Jesus Prayer has one aim, and one aim only. To
endow the person who says it with Christ-Consciousness. Not to set up some little cozy,
holier-than-thou tryst-ing place with some sticky, adorable divine personage who'll take
you in his arms and relieve you of all your duties and make all your nasty Weltschmerzen
and Professor Tuppers go away and never come back. And by God, if you have
intelligence enough to see that—and you do—and yet you refuse to see it, then you're
misusing the prayer, you're using it to ask for a world full of dolls and saints and no
Professor Tuppers." He suddenly sat up, shot forward, with an almost calisthenic-like
swiftness, to look at Franny. His shirt was, in the familiar phrase, wringing wet. "If Jesus
had intended the prayer to be used for—"
    Zooey broke off. He stared over at Franny's prostrate, face-down position on the
couch, and heard, probably for the first time, the only partly stifled sounds of anguish
coming from her. In an instant, he turned pale—pale with anxiety for Franny's condition,
and pale, presumably, because failure had suddenly filled the room with its invariably
sickening smell. The color of his pallor, however, was a curiously basic white —
unmixed, that is, with the greens and yellows of guilt or abject contrition. It was very like


the standard bloodlessness in the face of a small boy who loves animals to distraction, all
animals, and who has just seen his favorite, bunny-loving sister's expression as she
opened the box containing his birthday present to her—a freshly caught young cobra,
with a red ribbon tied in an awkward bow around its neck.
      He stared at Franny for a full minute, then got to his feet, with a little,
uncharacteristically awkward movement of imbalance. He went, very slowly, over to his
mother's writing table, on the other side of the room. And it was clear, on arrival, that he
had no idea why he'd gone over to it. He seemed unfamiliar with the things on the table
surface—the blotter with his filled-in "o"s, the ashtray with his cigar end in it— and he
turned around and looked at Franny again. Her sobbing had let up a bit, or seemed to
have, but her body was in the same wretched, prostrate, face-down position. One arm was
bent under her, caught under her, in a way that must have been acutely uncomfortable, if
not rather painful. Zooey looked away from her, and then, not unbravely, back at her. He
wiped his brow briefly with the palm of his hand, put the hand into his hip pocket to dry
it, and said, "I'm sorry, Franny. I'm very sorry." But this formal apology only reactivated,
reamplified, Franny's sobbing. He looked at her, fixedly, for another fifteen or twenty
seconds. Then he left the room, via the hall, closing the doors behind him.



THE fresh-paint smell was now quite strong just outside the living room. The hall itself
had not yet been painted, but newspapers had been strewn the entire length of the
hardwood floor, and Zooey's first step—an indecisive, almost dazed one—left the imprint
of his rubber heel on a sports-section photograph of Stan Musial holding up a fourteen-
inch brook trout. On his fifth or sixth step, he barely missed colliding with his mother,
who had just come out of her bedroom. "I thought you'd gone!" she said. She was
carrying two laundered and folded cotton bedspreads. "I thought I heard the front—" She
broke off to take in Zooey's general appearance. "What is that? Prespiration?" she asked.
Without waiting for a reply, she took Zooey by the arm and led him—almost swept him,
as if he were as light as a broom—into the daylight coming out of her freshly painted
bedroom. "It is prespiration." Her tone couldn't have held more wonder and censure if
Zooey's pores had been exuding crude oil. "What in the world have you been doing? You
just had a bath. What have you been doing?"
    "I'm late now, Fatty. C'mon. One side," Zooey said. A Philadelphia highboy had
been moved out into the hall, and, together with Mrs. Glass's person, it blocked Zooey's
passage. "Who put this monstrosity out here?" he said, glancing at it.
    "Why are you perspiring like that?" Mrs. Glass demanded, staring first at the shirt,
then at him. "Did you talk to Franny? Where've you just been? The living room?"
    "Yes, yes, the living room. And if I were you, incidentally, I'd go look in there for a
second. She's crying. Or was when I left." He tapped his mother on the shoulder. "C'mon,
now. I mean it. Get out of the—"
    "She's crying? Again? Why? What happened?"
    "I don't know, for Chrissake—I hid her Pooh books. Come on, Bessie, step aside,
please. I'm in a hurry."

 Mrs. Glass, still staring at him, let him pass. Then, almost at once, she made for the
living room, at a clip that scarcely gave her leave to call back over her shoulder, "Change
that shirt, young man!"
    If Zooey heard this, he gave no sign. At the far end of the hall, he went into the
bedroom he had once shared with his twin brothers, which now, in 1955, was his alone.
But he stayed in his room for not more than two minutes. When he came out, he had on
the same sweaty shirt. There was, however, a slight but fairly distinct change in his
appearance. He had acquired a cigar, and lighted it. And for some reason he had an
unfolded white handkerchief draped over his head, possibly to ward off rain, or hail, or
brimstone.
    He went directly across the hall and into the room his two eldest brothers had shared.
    This was the first time in almost seven years that Zooey had, in the ready-made
dramatic idiom, "set foot" in Seymour's and Buddy's old room. Discounting a totally
negligible incident a couple of years earlier, when he had methodically dragged the entire
apartment for a mislaid or "stolen" tennis-racket press.
     He closed the door behind him as tightly as possible, and with an expression
implying that the absence of a key in the lock met with his disapproval. He gave the room
itself scarcely a glance, once he was inside it. Instead, he turned around and deliberately
faced a sheet of what had once been snow-white beaverboard that was nailed
uncompromisingly to the back of the door. It was a mammoth specimen, very nearly as
long and as wide as the door itself. One could have believed that its whiteness,
smoothness, and expanse had at one time cried out rather plaintively for India ink and
block lettering. Certainly not in vain, if so. Every inch of visible surface of the board had
been decorated, with four somewhat gorgeous-looking columns of quotations from a
variety of the world's literatures. The lettering was minute, but jet-black and passionately
legible, if just a trifle fancy in spots, and without blots or erasures. The workmanship was
no less fastidious even at the bottom of the board, near the doorsill, where the two
penmen, each in his turn, had obviously lain on their stomachs. No attempt whatever had
been made to assign quotations or authors to categories or groups of any kind. So that to
read the quotations from top to bottom, column by column, was rather like walking
through an emergency station set up in a flood area, where, for example, Pascal had been
unribaldly bedded down with Emily Dickinson, and where, so to speak, Baudelaire's and
Thomas a Kempis's toothbrushes were hanging side by side.
    Zooey, standing in just close enough, read the top entry in the left-hand column, then
went on reading downward. From his expression, or lack of it, he might have been killing
time on a railway platform reading a billboard advertisement for Dr. Scholl's foot pads.



     You have the right to work, but for the work's sake only. You have no right to the
fruits of work. Desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working. Never
give way to laziness, either.
     Perform every action with your heart fixed on the Supreme Lord. Renounce
attachment to the fruits. Be even-tempered [underlined by one of the cal-ligraphers] in


success and failure; for it is this evenness of temper which is meant by yoga.
    Work done with anxiety about results is far inferior to work done without such

    Concerning the Gods, there are those who deny the very existence of the Godhead;
others say that it exists, but neither bestirs nor concerns itself nor has forethought for

heavenly matters, not for anything that is on earth. A fourth party admit things on earth as
well as in heaven, but only in general, and not with respect to each individual. A fifth, of
whom were Ulysses and Socrates, are those that cry: — "I move not without Thy
knowledge!" —Epictetus.

     He embraced Kitty, kissed her face, her hand, her face again, and made the sign of
the cross over her.
   And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man, till then so little

     The lettering on the beaverboard being as small as it was, this last entry appeared
well in the upper fifth of its column, and Zooey could have gone on reading for another
five minutes or so, staying in the same column, without having to bend his knees. He
didn't choose to. He turned around, not abruptly, and walked over and sat down at his
brother Seymour's desk— pulling out the little straight chair as though it were something
he did every day. He placed his cigar on the right-hand edge of the desk, bum-ing end
out, leaned forward on his elbows, and covered his face with his hands.
     Behind him and at his left, two curtained windows, with their blinds half drawn,
faced into a court—an unpicturesque brick-and-con-crete valley through which cleaning
women and grocery boys passed grayly at all hours of the day. The room itself was what
might be called the third master bedroom of the apartment, and was, by more or less
traditional Manhattan apartment-house standards, both unsunny and un-large. The two
eldest Glass boys, Seymour and Buddy, had moved into it in 1929, at the respective ages
of twelve and ten, and had vacated it when they were twenty-three and twenty-one. Most
of the furniture belonged to a maplewood "set": two day beds, a night table, two boyishly
small, knee-cramping desks, two chiffoniers, two semi-easy chairs. Three domestic
Oriental scatter rugs, extremely worn, were on the floor. The rest, with very little
exaggeration, was books. Meant-to-be-picked-up books. Permanently-left-behind books.
Uncertain-what-to-do-with books. But books, books. Tall cases lined three walls of the
room, filled to and beyond capacity. The overflow had been piled in stacks on the floor.
There was little space left for walking, and none whatever for pacing. A stranger with a
flair for cocktail-party descriptive prose might have commented that the room, at a quick
glance, looked as if it had once been tenanted by two struggling twelve-year-old lawyers

or researchists. And, in fact, unless one chose to make a fairly thoughtful survey of the
reading matter extant, there were few, if any, certain indications that the former
occupants had both reached voting age within the predominantly juvenile dimensions of
the room. True, there was a phone—the controversial private phone—on Buddy's desk.
And there were a number of cigarette burns on both desks. But other, more emphatic
signs of adulthood— stud or cuff-button boxes, wall pictures, the telling odds and ends
that collect on chiffonier tops —had been removed from the room in 1940, when the two
young men "branched out" and took an apartment of their own.
     With his face in his hands and his handkerchief headgear drooping low over his
brow, Zooey sat at Seymour's old desk, inert, but not asleep, for a good twenty minutes.
Then, almost in one movement, he removed the support for his face, picked up his cigar,
stowed it in his mouth, opened the left-hand bottom drawer of the desk, and took out,
using both hands, a seven- or eight-inch-thick stack of what appeared to be—and were—
shirt cardboards. He placed the stack before him on the desk and began to turn the cards
over, two or three at a time. His hand stayed only once, really, and then quite briefly.
    The cardboard that he stopped at had been written on in February, 1938. The
handwriting, in blue-lead pencil, was his brother Seymour's:
     My twenty-first birthday. Presents, presents, presents. Zooey and the baby, as usual,
shopped lower Broadway. They gave me a fine supply of itching powder and a box of
three stink bombs. I'm to drop the bombs in the elevator at Columbia or "someplace very
crowded" as soon as I get a good chance.
     Several acts of vaudeville tonight for my entertainment. Les and Bessie did a lovely
soft-shoe on sand swiped by Boo Boo from the urn in the lobby. When they were
finished, B. and Boo Boo did a pretty funny imitation of them. Les nearly in tears. The
baby sang "Abdul Abulbul Amir." Z. did the Will Mahoney exit Les taught him, ran
smack into the bookcase, and was furious. The twins did B.'s and my old Buck &
Bubbles imitation. But to perfection. Marvellous. In the middle of it, the doorman called
up on the housephone and asked if anybody was dancing up there. A Mr. Seligman, on
the fourth—
     There Zooey quit reading. He gave the stack of cardboards a solid-sounding double
tap on the desk surface, as one taps a deck of cards, then dropped the stack back into the
bottom drawer and closed the drawer.
    Once again he leaned forward on his elbows and buried his face in his hands. This
time he sat motionless for almost a half hour.
    When he moved again, it was as though marionette strings had been attached to him
and given an overzealous yank. He appeared to be given just enough time to pick up his
cigar before another jerk of the invisible strings swung him over to the chair at the second
desk in the room—Buddy's desk—where the phone was.
     In this new seating arrangement, the first thing he did was to pull his shirt ends out of
his trousers. He unbuttoned the shirt completely, as if the journey of three steps had taken
him into an oddly tropical zone. Next, he took his cigar out of his mouth, but transferred
it to his left hand and kept it there. With his right hand he took his handkerchief off his
head and laid it beside the phone, in what was very implicitly a "ready position." He then


picked up the phone without any perceptible hesitation and dialled a local number. A
very local number indeed. When he had finished dialling, he picked up his handkerchief
from the desk and put it over the mouthpiece, quite loosely and mounted rather high. He
took a deepish breath, and waited. He might have lighted his cigar, which had gone out,
but he didn't.



ABOUT a minute and a half earlier, Franny, on a distinctly quavering note, had just
declined her mother's fourth offer within fifteen minutes to bring in a cup of "nice, hot
chicken broth." Mrs. Glass had made this last offer on her feet —in fact, halfway out of
the living room, in the direction of the kitchen, looking rather grim with optimism. But
the reintroduced quaver in Franny's voice had sent her quickly back to her chair.
     Mrs. Glass's chair was, of course, on Franny's side of the living room. And most
vigilantly so. Some fifteen minutes earlier, when Franny had been rehabilitated enough to
sit up and look around for her comb, Mrs. Glass had brought over the straight chair from
the writing table and placed it squarely up against the coffee table. The site was excellent
for Franny-observ-ing, and also placed the observer within easy reach of an ashtray on
the marble surface.
     Re-seated, Mrs. Glass sighed, as she always sighed, in any situation, when cups of
chicken broth were declined. But she had, so to speak, been cruising in a patrol boat
down and up her children's alimentary canals for so many years that the sigh was in no
sense a real signal of defeat, and she said, almost immediately, "I don't see how you
expect to get your strength and all back if you don't take something nourishing into your
system. I'm sorry, but I don't. You've had exactly—"
     "Mother—now, please. I've asked you twenty times. Will you please stop
mentioning chicken broth to me? It nauseates me just to—" Franny broke off, and
listened. "Is that our phone?" she said.
      Mrs. Glass was already up from her chair. Her lips had tightened a bit. The ring of a
telephone, any telephone, anywhere, invariably caused Mrs. Glass's lips to tighten a bit.
"I'll be right back," she said, and left the room. She was chinking more audibly than
usual, as if a box of assorted household nails had come apart in one of her kimono
pockets.
     She was gone about five minutes. When she returned, she had the particular facial
expression that her eldest daughter, Boo Boo, had once described as meaning one of only
two things: that she had just talked with one of her sons on the telephone or that she had
just had a report, on the best authority, that the bowels of every single human being in the
world were scheduled to move with perfect hygienic regularity for a period of one full
week. "That's Buddy on the phone," she announced as she came into the room. From a
habit of several years' standing, she suppressed any small token of pleasure that might
have slipped into her voice.
    Franny's visible reaction to this news was considerably less than enthusiastic. She
looked, in fact, nervous. "Where's he phoning from?" she said.


     "I didn't even ask him. He sounds as though he has a horrible cold." Mrs. Glass didn't
sit down. She hovered. "Hurry up, now, young lady. He wants to talk to you."
    "Did he say so?"
    "Certainly he said so! Hurry up, now.... Put your slippers on."
     Franny let herself out of the pink sheets and the pale-blue afghan. She sat, pale and
obviously stalling, on the couch edge, looking up at her mother. Her feet fished around
for her slippers. "What'd you tell him?" she asked nervously.
    "Just kindly go to the phone, please, young lady," Mrs. Glass said evasively. "Just
hurry a little, for goodness' sake."
     "I suppose you told him I'm at death's door or something," Franny said. There was no
reply to this. She stood up from the couch, not so fragilely as a post-operative
convalescent might have but with just a trace of timidity and caution, as if she expected,
and perhaps rather hoped, to feel a trifle dizzy. She worked her feet more securely into
her slippers, then came out from behind the coffee table gravely, untying and relying the
belt of her dressing gown. A year or so earlier, in an unwarrantably self-deprecating
paragraph of a letter to her brother Buddy, she had referred to her own figure as
"irreproachably Americanese." Watching her, Mrs. Glass, who happened to be a great
judge of young girls' figures and young girls' walks, once again, in lieu of a smile,
tightened her lips a bit. The instant, however, that Franny was out of sight, she turned her
attention to the couch. Clearly, from her look, there were not many things in the world
she disliked more than a couch, a good eiderdown couch, that had been made up for
sleeping purposes. She went around into the aisle made by the coffee table and began to
give all the pillows in sight a therapeutic beating up.
     Franny, in transit, ignored the telephone in the hall. She evidently preferred to take
the longish walk down the hall to her parents' bedroom, where the more popular phone in
the apartment was located. Although there was nothing markedly peculiar about her gait
as she moved through the hall—she neither dallied nor quite hurried—she was
nonetheless very peculiarly transformed as she moved. She appeared, vividly, to grow
younger with each step. Possibly long halls, plus the aftereffects of tears, plus the ring of
a telephone, plus the smell of fresh paint, plus newspapers underfoot—possibly the sum
of all these things was equal, for her, to a new doll carriage. In any case, by the time she
reached her parents' bedroom door her handsome tailored tie-silk dressing gown—the
emblem, perhaps, of all that is dormitorially chic and fatale—looked as if it had been
changed into a small child's woollen bathrobe.
     Mr. and Mrs. Glass's bedroom reeked, and even smarted, of freshly painted walls.
The furniture had been herded into the middle of the room and covered with canvas—old,
paint-flecked, organic-looking canvas. The beds, too, had been drawn in from the wall,
but they had been covered with cotton bedspreads Mrs. Glass herself had provided. The
phone was now on the pillow of Mr. Glass's bed. Evidently Mrs. Glass, too, had preferred
it to the less private extension in the hall. The handpiece lay detached from its catch,
waiting for Franny. It looked almost as dependent as a human being for some
acknowledgment of its existence. To get to it, to redeem it, Franny had to shuffle across
the floor through a quantity of newspapers and sidestep an empty paint bucket. When she


did reach it, she didn't pick it up but merely sat down beside it on the bed, looked at it,
looked away from it, and pushed back her hair. The night table that ordinarily stood
alongside the bed had been moved close enough to it so that Franny could reach it
without quite standing up. She put her hand under a particularly soiled-looking piece of
canvas covering it and passed the hand back and forth till she found what she was looking
for—a porcelain cigarette box and a box of matches in a copper holder. She lit a cigarette,
then gave the phone another, long, exceedingly worried look. With the exception of her
late brother Seymour, it should be noted, all her brothers had overly vibrant, not to say
sinewy, voices on the telephone. At this hour, it was very possible that Franny felt deeply
hesitant about taking a chance on just the timbre, let alone the verbal content, of any of
her brothers' voices on the phone. However, she puffed nervously on her cigarette and,
rather bravely, picked up the phone. "Hello. Buddy?" she said.
    "Hello, sweetheart. How are you—are you all right?"
    "I'm fine. How are you? You sound as though you have a cold." Then, when there
was no immediate response: "I suppose Bessie's been briefing you by the hour."
    "Well—after a fashion. Yes and no. You know. Are you all right, sweetheart?"
     "I'm fine. You sound funny, though. Either you have a terrible cold or this is a
terrible connection. Where are you, anyway?"
     "Where am I? I'm right in my element, Flop-sy. I'm in a little haunted house down
the road. Never mind. Just talk to me."
    Franny unplacidly crossed her legs. "I don't know exactly what you'd like to talk
about," she said. "What all'd Bessie tell you, I mean?"
     There was a most characteristically Buddy-like pause at the other end. It was exactly
the kind of pause—just a trifle rich with seniority of years—that had often tried the
patience of both Franny and the vif tuoso at the other end of the phone when they were
small children. "Well, I'm not terribly sure what all she told me, sweetheart. Past a certain
point, it's a little rude to go on listening to Bessie on the phone. I heard about the
cheeseburger diet, you can be sure. And, of course, the Pilgrim books. Then I think I just
sat with the phone at my ear, not really listening. You know."
     "Oh," Franny said. She switched her cigarette over to her telephone hand and, with
her free hand, reached again under the canvas cover on the night table and found a tiny
ceramic ashtray, which she placed beside her on the bed. "You sound funny," she said.
"Do you have a cold, or what?"
     "I feel wonderful, sweetheart. I'm sitting here talking to you and I feel wonderful. It's
a joy to hear your voice. I can't tell you."
    Franny once again pushed back her hair with one hand. She didn't say anything.
     "Flopsy? Can you think of anything Bessie may have missed? You feel like talking
at all?"
     With her fingers, Franny slightly altered the position of the tiny ashtray beside her on
the bed. "Well," she said, "I'm a little talked out, to be honest with you. Zooey's been at
me all morning."


   "Zooey? How is he?"
    "How is he? He's fine. He's just tiptop. I could just murder him, that's all."
    "Murder him? Why? Why, sweetheart? Why could you murder our Zooey?"
     "Why? Because I just could, that's all! He's completely destructive. I've never met
anyone so completely destructive in my life! It's just so unnecessary! One minute he
launches this all-out attack on the Jesus Prayer—which I happen to be interested in—
making you think you're some kind of neurotic nitwit for even being interested in it. And
about two minutes later he starts raving to you about how Jesus is the only person in the
world he's ever had any respect for —such a marvellous mind, and all that. He's just so
erratic. I mean he goes around and around in such horrible circles."
    "Tell about it. Tell about the horrible circles."
     Here Franny made the mistake of giving a little exhalation of impatience—she had
just inhaled cigarette smoke. She coughed. "Tell about it! It would just take me all day,
that's all!" She put a hand to her throat, and waited for the wrong-passage discomfort to
pass. "He's just a monster," she said. "He is! Not really a monster but—I don't know. He's
so bitter about things. He's bitter about religion. He's bitter about television. He's bitter
about you and Seymour— he keeps saying you both made freaks out of us. I don't know.
He jumps from one—"
   "Why freaks? I know he thinks that. Or thinks he thinks it. But did he say why?
What's his definition of a freak? He say, sweetheart?"
     Just here, Franny, in apparent despair at the naivete of the question, struck her
forehead with her hand. Something she very probably hadn't done in five or six years—
when, for example, halfway home on the Lexington Avenue bus, she discovered she had
left her scarf back at the movies. "What's his definition?" she said. "He has about forty
definitions for everything! If I sound slightly unhinged, that's the reason why. One
minute—like last night—he says we're freaks because we were brought up to have only
one set of standards. Ten minutes later he says he's a freak because he never wants to
meet anybody for a drink. The only time—"
    "Never wants to what?"
     "Meet anybody for a drink. Oh, he had to go out last night and meet this television
writer for a drink downtown, in the Village and all. That's what started it. He says the
only people he ever really wants to meet for a drink somewhere are all either dead or
unavailable. He says he never even wants to have lunch with anybody, even, unless he
thinks there's a good chance it's going to turn out to be Jesus, the person—or the Buddha,
or Hui-neng, or Shankaracharya, or somebody like that. You know." Franny suddenly put
out her cigarette in the tiny ashtray—with some awkwardness, not having her second
hand free to brace the ashtray. "You know what else he said to me?" she said. "You know
what he swore up and down to me? He told me last night he once had a glass of ginger
ale with Jesus in the kitchen when he was eight years old. Are you listening?"
     "I'm listening, I'm listening . . . sweetheart." "He said he was—this is exactly what he
said —he said he was sitting at the table in the kitchen, all by himself, drinking a glass o£
ginger ale and eating saltines and reading 'Dombey and Son,' and all of a sudden Jesus sat

down in the other chair and asked if he could have a small glass of ginger ale. A small
glass, mind you —that's exactly what he said. I mean he says things like that, and yet he
thinks he's perfectly qualified to give me a lot of advice and stuff! That's what makes me
so mad! I could just spit! I could I It's like being in a lunatic asylum and having another
patient all dressed up as a doctor come over to you and start taking your pulse or
something.... It's just awful. He talks and talks and talks. And if he isn't talking, he's
smoking bis smelly cigars all over the house. I'm so sick of the smell of cigar smoke I
could just roll over and die."
     "The cigars are ballast, sweetheart. Sheer ballast. If he didn't have a cigar to hold on
to, his feet would leave the ground. We'd never see our Zooey again."
      There were several experienced verbal stunt pilots in the Glass family, but this last
little remark perhaps Zooey alone was coordinated well enough to bring in safely over a
telephone. Or so this narrator suggests. And Franny may have felt so, too. In any case,
she suddenly knew that it was Zooey at the other end of the phone. She got up, slowly,
from the edge of the bed. "All right, Zooey," she said, "All right."
    Not quite immediately: "Beg pardon?"
    "I said, all right, Zooey."
    "Zooey? What is this? ... Franny? You there?"
    "I'm here. Just stop it now, please. I know it's you."
   "What in the world are you talking about, sweetheart? What is this? Who's this
Zooey?"
    "Zooey Glass," Franny said. "Just stop it now, please. You're not being funny. As it
happens, I'm just barely getting back to feeling halfway—"
    "Grass, did you say? Zooey Grass? Norwegian chap? Sort of a heavyset, blond,
ath—"
     "All right, Zooey. Just stop, please. Enough's enough. You're not funny. ... In case
you're interested, I'm feeling absolutely lousy. So if there's anything special you have to
say to me,
    please hurry up and say it and leave me alone." This last, emphasized word was
oddly veered away from, as if the stress on it hadn't been fully intended.
     There was a peculiar silence at the other end o£ the phone. And a peculiar reaction to
it from Franny. She was disturbed by it. She sat down again on the edge of her father's
bed. "I'm not going to hang up on you or anything," she said. "But I'm—I don't know—
I'm tired, Zooey. I'm just exhausted, frankly." She listened. But there was no response.
She crossed her legs. "You can go on like this all day, but I can't," she said. "All I am is
on the receiving end. It isn't terribly pleasant, you know. You think everybody's made of
iron or something." She listened. She started to speak up again but stopped when she
heard the sound of a voice being cleared.
    "I don't think everybody's made of iron, buddy."
    This abjectly simple sentence seemed to disturb Franny rather more than a continued


silence would have. She quickly reached over and picked a cigarette out of the porcelain
box, but didn't prepare to light it. "Well, you'd think you did," she said. She listened. She
waited. "I mean, did you call for any special reason?" she said abruptly. "I mean, did you
have any special reason for calling me?"
    "No special reason, buddy, no special reason."
    Franny waited. Then the other end spoke up again.
    "I suppose I more or less called to tell you to go on with your Jesus Prayer if you
want to. I mean that's your business. That's your business. It's a goddam nice prayer, and
don't let anybody tell you anything different."
    "I know," Franny said. Very nervously, she reached for the box of matches.
    "I don't think I ever really meant to try to stop you from saying it. At least, I don't
think I did. I don't know. I don't know what the hell was going on in my mind. There's
one thing I do know for sure, though. I have no goddam authority to be speaking up like a
seer the way I have been. We've had enough goddam seers in this family. That part
bothers me. That part scares me a little bit."
      Franny took advantage of the slight pause that followed to straighten her back a
trifle, as though, for some reason, good posture, or better posture, might come in handy at
any moment.
     "It scares me a little bit, but it doesn't petrify me. Let's get that straight. It doesn't
petrify me. Because you forget one thing, buddy. When you first felt the urge, the call, to
say the prayer, you didn't immediately start searching the four corners of the world for a
master. You came home. You not only came home but you went into a goddam collapse.
So if you look at it in a certain way, by rights you're only entitled to the low-grade
spiritual counsel we're able to give you around here, and no more. At least you know
there won't be any goddam ulterior motives in
    this madhouse. Whatever we are, we're not fishy, buddy."
     Franny suddenly tried with one hand alone to get a light for her cigarette. She opened
the matchbox compartment successfully, but one inept scratch of a match sent the box to
the floor. She bent quickly and picked up the box, and let the spilled matches lie.
     "I'll tell you one thing, Franny. One thing I know. And don't get upset. It isn't
anything bad. But if it's the religious life you want, you ought to know right now that
you're missing out on every single goddam religious action that's going on around this
house. You don't even have sense enough to drink when somebody brings you a cup of
consecrated chicken soup—which is the only kind of chicken soup Bessie ever brings to
anybody around this madhouse. So just tell me, just tell me, buddy. Even if you went out
and searched the whole world for a master —some guru, some holy man—to tell you
how to say your Jesus Prayer properly, what good would it do you? How in hell are you
going to recognize a legitimate holy man when you see one if you don't even know a cup
of consecrated chicken soup when it's right in front of your nose? Can you tell me that?"
    Franny was now sitting up rather abnormally straight.
    "I'm just asking you. I'm not trying to upset you. Am I upsetting you?"

   Franny answered, but her answer evidently didn't carry.
    "What? I can't hear you."
    "I said no. Where are you calling from? Where are you now?"
     "Oh, what the hell's the difference where I am? Pierre, South Dakota, for God's sake.
Listen to me, Franny—I'm sorry, don't get riled. But listen to me. I have just one or two
very small things more, and then I'll quit, I promise you that. But did you know, just by
the way, that Buddy and I drove up to see you in stock last summer? Did you know we
saw you in 'Playboy of the Western World' one night? One god-awful hot night, I can tell
you that. But did you know we were there?"
    An answer seemed to be called for. Franny stood up, then immediately sat down. She
placed the ashtray slightly away from her, as if it were very much in her way. "No, I
didn't," she said. "Nobody said one single—No, I didn't."
      "Well, we were. We were. And I'll tell you, buddy. You were good. And when I say
good, I mean good. You held that goddam mess up. Even all those sunburned lobsters in
the audience knew it. And now I hear you're finished with the theatre forever—I hear
things, I hear things. And I remember the spiel you came back with when the season was
over. Oh, you irritate me, Franny! I'm sorry, you do. You've made the great startling
goddam discovery that the acting profession's loaded with mercenaries and butchers. As I
remember, you even looked like somebody who'd just been shattered because all the
ushers hadn't been geniuses. What's the master with you, buddy? Where are your brains?
If you've had a freakish education, at least use it, use it. You can say the Jesus Prayer
from now till doomsday, but if you don't realize that the only thing that counts in the
religious life is detachment, I don't see how you'll ever even move an inch. Detachment,
buddy, and only detachment. Desirelessness. 'Cessation from all hankerings.' It's this
business of desiring, if you want to know the goddam truth, that makes an actor in the
first place. Why're you making me tell you things you already know? Somewhere along
the line—in one damn incarnation or another, if you like—you not only had a hankering
to be an actor or an actress but to be a good one. You're stuck with it now. You can't just
walk out on the results of your own hankerings. Cause and effect, buddy, cause and
effect. The only thing you can do now, the only religious thing you can do, is act. Act for
God, if you want to— be God's actress, if you want to. What could be prettier? You can
at least try to, if you want to —there's nothing wrong in trying." There was a slight pause.
"You'd better get busy, though, buddy. The goddam sands run out on you every time you
turn around. I know what I'm talking about. You're lucky if you get time to sneeze in this
goddam phenomenal world." There was another, slighter pause. "I used to worry about
that. I don't worry about it very much any more. At least I'm still in love with Yorick's
skull. At least I always have time enough to stay in love with Yorick's skull. I want an
honorable goddam skull when I'm dead, buddy. I hanker after an honorable goddam skull
like Yorick's. And so do you, Franny Glass. So do you, so do you. . . . Ah, God, what's
the use of talking? You had the exact same goddam freakish upbringing I did, and if you
don't know by this time what kind of skull you want when you're dead, and what you
have to do to earn it—I mean if you don't at least know by this time that if you're an
actress you're supposed to act, then what's the use of talking?"
    Franny was now sitting with the flat of her free hand pressed against the side of her

face, like someone with an excruciating toothache.
     "One other thing. And that's all. I promise you. But the thing is, you raved and you
bitched when you came home about the stupidity of audiences. The goddam 'unskilled
laughter' coming from the fifth row. And that's right, that's right—God knows it's
depressing. I'm not saying it isn't. But that's none of your business, really. That's none of
your business, Franny. An artist's only concern is to shoot for some kind of perfection,
and on his own terms, not anyone else's. You have no right to think about those things, I
swear to you. Not in any real sense, anyway. You know what I mean?"
     There was a silence. Both saw it through without any seeming impatience or
awkwardness. Franny still appeared to have some considerable pain on one side of her
face, and continued to keep her hand on it, but her expression was markedly
uncomplaining.
     The voice at the other end came through again. "I remember about the fifth time I
ever went on 'Wise Child.' I subbed for Walt a few times when he was in a cast—
remember when he was in that cast? Anyway, I started bitching one night before the
broadcast. Seymour'd told me to shine my shoes just as I was going out the door with
Waker. I was furious. The studio audience were all morons, the announcer was a moron,
the sponsors were morons, and I just damn well wasn't going to shine my shoes for them,
I told Seymour. I said they couldn't see them anyway, where we sat. He said to shine
them anyway. He said to shine them for the Fat Lady. I didn't know what the hell he was
talking about, but he had a very Seymour look on his face, and so I did it. He never did
tell me who the Fat Lady was, but I shined my shoes for the Fat Lady every time I ever
went on the air again—all the years you and I were on the program together, if you
remember. I don't think I missed more than just a couple of times. This terribly clear,
clear picture of the Fat Lady formed in my mind. I had her sitting on this porch all day,
swatting flies, with her radio going full-blast from morning till night. I figured the heat
was terrible, and she probably had cancer, and—I don't know. Anyway, it seemed
goddam clear why Seymour wanted me to shine my shoes when I went on the air. It made
sense"
     Franny was standing. She had taken her hand away from her face to hold the phone
with two hands. "He told me, too," she said into the phone. "He told me to be funny for
the Fat Lady, once." She released one hand from the phone and placed it, very briefly, on
the crown of her head, then went back to holding the phone with both hands. "I didn't
ever picture her on a porch, but with very—you know—very thick legs, very veiny. I had
her in an awful wicker chair. She had cancer, too, though, and she had the radio going
full-blast all day! Mine did, too!"
     "Yes. Yes. Yes. All right. Let me tell you something now, buddy. . . . Are you
listening?"
    Franny, looking extremely tense, nodded.
     "I don't care where an actor acts. It can be in summer stock, it can be over a radio, it
can be over television, it can be in a goddam Broadway theatre, complete with the most
fashionable, most well-fed, most sunburned-looking audience you can imagine. But I'll
tell you a terrible secret—Are you listening to me? There isn't anyone out there who isn't


Seymour's Fat Lady. That includes your Professor Tupper, buddy. And all his goddam
cousins by the dozens. There isn't anyone anywhere that isn't Seymour's Fat Lady. Don't
you know that? Don't you know that goddam secret yet? And don't you know—listen to
me, now—don't you know who that Fat Lady really is? . . . Ah, buddy. Ah, buddy. It's
Christ Himself. Christ Himself, buddy."
    For joy, apparently, it was all Franny could do to hold the phone, even with both
hands.
     For a fullish half minute or so, there were no other words, no further speech. Then: "I
can't talk any more, buddy." The sound of a phone being replaced in its catch followed.
     Franny took in her breath slightly but continued to hold the phone to her ear. A dial
tone, of course, followed the formal break in the connection. She appeared to find it
extraordinarily beautiful to listen to, rather as if it were the best possible substitute for the
primordial silence itself. But she seemed to know, too, when to stop listening to it, as if
all of what little or much wisdom there is in the world were suddenly hers. When she had
replaced the phone, she seemed to know just what to do next, too. She cleared away the
smoking things, then drew back the cotton bedspread from the bed she had been sitting
on, took off her slippers, and got into the bed. For some minutes, before she fell into a
deep, dreamless sleep, she just lay quiet, smiling at the ceiling.
